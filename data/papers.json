    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available. %We release an open-source implementation to support\ncontinued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as\nevidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized\ncontributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks\nsemantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With\nthe purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the\nworld, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of\ntranslating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we\nargue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a\nneurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the\nneural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic\nAI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are\nsatisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction\napproaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a\nframework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural\nnetworks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various\nexisting approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how\nlogical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we\nreview some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for\nneural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our\nframework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic\nencoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature\nsearch, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

In this work, we show how to\noptimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control\nenvironments.

To get around the\nconstraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack\ndynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then\nshow that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial\nimprovement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87\nto 0.41 using our scaffold.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K.

    "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains.

    "abstract": "The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development\nof generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable\nconditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and\nprovide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling\nchoices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional\ngenerative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input\nrepresentation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE\n(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),\na scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an\nautoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like\nmolecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The\nlatent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property\npredictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the\nlatent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:\n(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on\nSELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable\nformulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with\nlow-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation\nwith limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,\nour approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal\nsmooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional\nexploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the\nconditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted\nbinding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains\ncompetitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning\nand parameter-efficient finetuning.",

    "abstract": "Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of\ninnovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same\ntime, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior\nwork has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if\ninference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer\nsolutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we\nintroduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.\nWe demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads\ncan all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that\nhad been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter\n-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper\nintroduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked\ntogether with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and\nsemantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache\nlocality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can\nenable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we\ndemonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two\ndistinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be\noptimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called\nlost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span\nquery on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock\ninference server using an 8b model.",

With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities\nthrough transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can\ndeliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent\nwithout substantially compromising the reasoning quality.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,\ndelivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.\nHowever, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts\nfundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and\ncomputational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and\nreveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and\nadaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver\nscalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.",

To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop\na simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\n(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.\nEmpirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL\nbenchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited\ndata.",

This will\nlead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,\nretain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and\nenvironments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G\nnetworks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a\nmethod for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite\nits rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the\nfoundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a\nuniversally accepted definition.\n  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G\nnetworks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case\nthat applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic\nAI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress\nfrom workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design\npatterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then\ndescribed to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated.

    "abstract": "Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed\nacross institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of\ndiscriminatory patterns embedded in historical data.

This Review examines methodological\nfoundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal\nrepresentation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and\ncounterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating\nclinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,\ncancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological\nmonitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting\nprescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific\nCausal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with\nintegration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph\nneural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,\nincluding computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,\nvalidation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond\ncross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal\nterminology without rigorous evidentiary support.

To better handle the interdependency across location and routing\ndecisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism\ndesigned to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages.

WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic\nframes and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,\nenabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,\nto further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is\nintroduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding\nmethods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current\nsemantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the\nreference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth\nefficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.\nExperimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based\nmethods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.",

This study proposes a novel\nframework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making\nprocess by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.\nEach agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction\nbased on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic\nindicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by\nobserving the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus\nformation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable\nrepresenting each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we\ntheoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input\ninformation and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this\ndebate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines\nin prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides\ninsights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective\npolicy forecasts.",

However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,\nour VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the\nbaseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical\ntask-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable\nsubgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled\nby an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the\ntree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent\nnodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent\nnode retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and\nshares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on\nthe WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently\noutperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.\nNotably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5\n72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.",

    "abstract": "With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question\nof their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods\nfrom the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision\nand Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.\nThe associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation\nposes several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for\nestimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We\nconduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a\nbyproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also\nshow that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature\nwhich by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we\nstudy the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various\nsettings.",

This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to\nthree heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify\nsubstantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.\nCritically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models\ntrained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation\ncompared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and\nmitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training\ncorpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain\ngeneralization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for\nbias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and\nadvancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across\ndiverse patient populations and clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of\nautomating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements.\nHowever, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines,\nwhich oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle\nwith complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose\nEvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven\ndevelopment. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued\nfeatures and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly\nmodels dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains\nmulti-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is\npropagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development\niterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and\nshow that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a\nsubstantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by\n16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of\ndependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for\ncomplex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing\niterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of\nbase LLMs to better support iterative software development.",

While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical\nstandard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently\nsubjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to\nautomate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and\nefficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network\narchitectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal\npatterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current\nmodels often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially\nwhen dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in\nbiomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.",

During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results.

Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

However, this assumption is at\nodds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,\nmaking these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.\nIn this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model\nfor Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a\nstable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to\ninfer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that\nSCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional\nregulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has\nirreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through\ntranscription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the\naccuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the\ndiscovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have\nsubsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by\nutilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the\ntransformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic\nchanges within regulatory networks during the process.",

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative\nuncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality\nfollowing, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into\nhow MLLMs resolve conflicting information.",

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy.

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

    "abstract": "Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their\npotential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific\nliterature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on\nsimplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These\napproaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but\noverlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,\nwhich are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human\nliterature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention \"keyword A\" and\n\"keyword B\" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.\nAdditionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using\nthe model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the\nscientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established\nresearch. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework\nto address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures\nkeyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven\nideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to\niteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A\ncritic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by\nproviding continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our\nexperiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by\n10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference\nacceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in\nscientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each\ncomponent in the workflow.

    "abstract": "Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.\nThese tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses\nbetween LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,\nespecially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program\ncontinuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on\nreal-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models\nshows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,\nand remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading\nschemes.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its\nearly diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The\nproposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to\ncompensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and\nmodality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to\nexplicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental\nresults on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior\ndiagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is\nensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected\nautonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated\nusing a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%\nreduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to\ntraditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs\nimproved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.\nThese findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for\nreal-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.",

Current techniques\nfor strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,\nlimiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring\npurposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and\nefficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry\nplant phenotyping.",

    "abstract": "Boolean equivalence allows Boolean networks with identical functionality to\nexhibit diverse graph structures. This gives more room for exploration in logic\noptimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency\nbetween Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton,\na novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency\nand reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key\nsteps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is\ntransformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned\nthe functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous\npatterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous\npatterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies,\nwhile homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further\nconstrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over\nthe granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness,\nwe conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network:\ncompression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing\nprediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore,\nit improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean\nnetwork for the timing prediction task. These experiments underscore the\npotential of BoolSkeleton to enhance design consistency in logic synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios\nlike vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This\ngap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,\nshaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences\n(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling\nand semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling\nhuman-centric decisions.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a\nwide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular\ndiseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal\nvessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the\nquantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature\ndiffers significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it\nconsists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology\nvaries greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges\nto segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nMM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel\nsegmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which\nreplace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception\nthrough morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective\nState Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space\nmodeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in\nsegmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves\nF1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and advancement.

In practice, observational data are often\nmissing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission\nissues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and\nrisk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction\naccuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate\nrobustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of\nextraneous variables.

This paper\nintroduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.\nBuilt upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework\nsupports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,\nranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts\nover those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing\narbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal\nproofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)\nsystematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)\nautomatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level\nguarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study\non an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor\nfusion.

    "abstract": "The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now\nraising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation\ndetection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the\nlegal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.\nAlthough several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three\ncritical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or\ndiffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,\nscratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail\nto capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair\ncomparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in\nsecurity-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking\nframework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and\nreproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,\nfrozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and\ndiffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate\nperformance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,\nROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model\ninterpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations\ndemonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods\nexhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model\ntransferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a\ndeeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic\napproaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and\nexplainable solutions.",

    "abstract": "We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios\nwhere generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful\nreasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in\nMIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as\nsketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning\nprocess. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and\ndesigning textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited\nimprovements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the\ncritical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning\non MIRA.",

    "abstract": "Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action\nin the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D\nheads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder\nfollowed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through\niterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At\nthe heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on\nDINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric\nand appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nnovel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to\nextreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this\nbase model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the\nencoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry\nand style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control\ngeometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.\nWe highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model\nthrough a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt\ngeometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural\nlanguage or image prompts.\n  Project Page: https://antoniooroz.github.io/PercHead Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFybgTk4kE",

    "abstract": "The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been\nshown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream\ncapabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant\nprogress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of\nvideo data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing\nthe capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal\nseveral key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly\ndepends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)\nand text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,\nespecially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision\nsystems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution\nmethods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to\ninterpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI\nsystems.",

At the\ncore of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),\nspecifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These\nmodels undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning\nfor injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement\nlearning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data\ninfrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)\nconsisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples.

The proposed\nrobust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster\nbiometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a\nnewly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos\ncollected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,\nwe provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack\ndetection approaches.

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land\ncover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current\nmodels typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and\ncannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic\nchange detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange\nintegrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.\nOur model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction\nof three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows\nUniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even\nwhen their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks\n(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,\nachieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,\nsurpassing all previous methods.

Existing solutions\neither rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are\ntraining-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing\nto produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the\nTraining-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a\nnovel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,\nNoise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent\nrepresentations from both foreground and composite generation processes,\ntransplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures\nsemantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite\nlayers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring\nfine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that\nintroduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,\nwe include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and\nview biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale\nstabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to\nreinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for\nmotion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment\n(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical\nTemporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;\nand (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces\ncross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite\nadding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,\nMTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude\nlevels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS\ndatasets.

The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from\n2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently\nannotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from\nacross India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14\nvehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler\n(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,\nHatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k\nconsensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct\nobjects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,\nwe train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,\nand DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,\nmAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in\nmAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with\nRT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40\nfor COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This\ndemonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic\nscenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus\nannotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the\n6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the\nheterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera\nstreams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and\noffers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of\nintelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,\ninvolving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,\nconvey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been\nmanually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video\nediting technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often\nfail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To\naddress this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for\nvideo shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching\nbetween the script generated by a large language model and a video library to\nobtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we\nsegment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such\nas shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models\nto learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their\nalignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization\nby combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the\nassembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the\narrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,\nnarrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style\nof reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual\nexpression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience\ncan create visually compelling videos. Project page:\nhttps://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com",

    "abstract": "The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where\nfoundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nshow great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for\nspecialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation\nstrategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new\nmulti-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this\nbenchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies\non a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter\nrecommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that\nthe optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT\nand ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by\ncontext-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of\n0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the\nsuperior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a\npowerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm\nthe superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual\ninterference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked\nagainst strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer\nkey observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our\nbenchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for\ndeveloping more effective science-based agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial\nfor measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

Each object is captured using 35\nDSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the\nsimulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we\nprovide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric\nsurface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct\nan extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world\nobject-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation.

    "abstract": "Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple\ncamera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

However, missing values due to blinks, pupil\ndetection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for\nfurther gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation).

This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to\nthree heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify\nsubstantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.\nCritically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models\ntrained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation\ncompared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and\nmitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training\ncorpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet\nimportant task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm\nhas been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised\nrepresentation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited\namounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data.

In response to this challenge, we propose the\nRxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).\nOur framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing\nprocess into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed \"BBox and Index as\nVisual Prompt\" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,\nMolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the\ninput image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language\ndescription problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy\nsignificantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model\ndesign. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude\nlarger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset\nacross four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Firstly, it\nperforms global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This\ninvolves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights\nto decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical\ninformation: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution\n(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress\nfalse positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses\nthese decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for\ncomprehensive and robust OOD detection.

    "abstract": "The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep\nlearning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point\ncloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for\n3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,\nleading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge\ndevices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging\nSplit Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split\nComputing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby\nreducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the\nrisk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep\nneural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after\nvoxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution\ntime by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced\nby up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.",

However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy\ncamera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of\ndepth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the\nstyle of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated\nimages with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains\nbetween real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a\nlatent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by\nreducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central\nairway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on\nthe depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated\nsynthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent\ndomain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature\nconsistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway\nphantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on\nboth absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results\nacross various backbones and pretrained weights.

Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The\nproposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to\ncompensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and\nmodality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to\nexplicitly align the latent distributions across modalities.

    "abstract": "Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United\nStates, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for\napproximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and\nefficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry\nplant phenotyping.",

Methods: We\ncollected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566\nparticipants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language\nmodel (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET\nimages.

Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in\nboth structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns\n(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show\nhigh agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80).

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a\nwide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular\ndiseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal\nvessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the\nquantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature\ndiffers significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it\nconsists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology\nvaries greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges\nto segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nMM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel\nsegmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which\nreplace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception\nthrough morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective\nState Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space\nmodeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in\nsegmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves\nF1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and advancement.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The\nefficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector\nframework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across\nvarious frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions.

To overcome these limitations,\nthis study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from\ndigital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)\ninitial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a\nbinary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for\nquasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation\nAxis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA.

In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates\ninstance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in\nforaminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically\nreconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed\ntomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple\ninstance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of\nthe chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order\nreconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort\nwhile maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation\nmodels exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel\nfidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm\nremains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental\ntrajectories even under partial segmentation.

We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to\nquantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.\nGRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without\naccess to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K.

In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains.

Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for\nevery input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In\nthis work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller\nLLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and\ncost-controllable manner.

To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework\nthat optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget\nsetting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a\nsingle system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while\nmaintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and\ncost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.",

Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate.

We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

Our work\naddresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and\nconducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task\ntypes, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning\ntasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge\nreduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing\nexcessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of\nhallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar\ncontexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar\nquestions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge\nlearning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved\nperformance.",

Existing\nKT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill\ntags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important\nsource of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while\nlimiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing\n(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using\npretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories\nand question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in\nboth behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves\nperformance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better\nto cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of\nquestion content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained\nrepresentations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.",

However, applying these models to\nthe fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available\ndatasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k\nhigh-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos\ncovering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data\nare annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding\nboxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications\nsuch as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers\nclear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data\nquality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world\nscenarios.

We also compare the results against\n100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We\nreport two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve\nremarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically\nsignificant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025\ndata demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance\non unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample\nperiod. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting\nadvantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be\nomitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results\nprovide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even\non out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,\nwhile revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts\ncompared to human panels.",

    "abstract": "While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like\nfinance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,\nand multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training\n(CPT) \"experts\" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable\nmulti-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmodel-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address\nthis gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and\nJapanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,\ncomplementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task\nArithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated\nfrom 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an\nexpert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while\nmerging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain\nskills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is\nhyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also\nsuggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent\nskills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first\nfoundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework\nand providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing\nassets.",

    "abstract": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the\ndecomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to\nagents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited\nto the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned\nCooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for\nlearning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks.",

Despite\npromising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,\nin which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining\ncollaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this\npaper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior\nnaturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and\nefficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.\nFinally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost\nin multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter\nthis, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by\nallowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate\ninstructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and\nunlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning\ntasks.",

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples\nthe space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to\ncreate realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our\nevaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using\nLLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge\ntreatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as\nevaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but\nnon-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data.

From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of\ngradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the\ndistilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%\nSpearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo\nstudents. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",

    "abstract": "The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while\nthe vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the\nfoundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to\nsupport new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the\nmodels towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation\nmodels for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose\nmodels like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization.",

Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning\n(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without\ncentralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing\nsensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a\nclient's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can\nlaunch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client\nparticipated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a\nclient's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),\nthereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing\ninputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client\nexposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates\nmost relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat\nvectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)\nadversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted\ncentral server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes\nthat the server has access to a validation/test set with global data\ndistribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds\nshowed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with\n147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in\ngeneral the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be\nefficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10\ndataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy\nimprovement and 33% cumulative privacy.",

In this paper, we\nshow that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by\nits adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.\nMore specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the\nmanifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness\nmeasure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a\ncontinuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We\nfurther demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a\nwell-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,\nSGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\\tr(\\mH)$,\nwhereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\\tr(\\Diag(\\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In\nsolving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this\ndistinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than\nSGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of\nadaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,\nand provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce\nsharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.",

Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions.

To unlock\ntheir potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that\ntransfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a\nshared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation\nduring multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an\nMoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse\ncooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency\nand performance of backbone algorithms.

Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,\nConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.\nThis concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more\nlikely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,\nwhen finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than\nMeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical\ndecision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to\nstop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical\ndecisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense\nthat they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide\nexplicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of\nusability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until\nmastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship\nbetween model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:\nteachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research\nis needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use\nKT models.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states.

Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,\ndelivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.\nHowever, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts\nfundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and\ncomputational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and\nreveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and\nadaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver\nscalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.",

We\ntest various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits\nsuperior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage\noperators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price\nstabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price\ndynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as\nvolatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.\nRemarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained\nwithout explicitly calibrating the model to price data.

Guided by this, we investigate the\nconnection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)\nclasses, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the\neffective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,\neven for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for\nvarious notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes\nsatisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that\nCPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that\nrealize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes\nsatisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER.

An attacker\ncontrolling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them\nwithin ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography.

We\nformalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification\nframework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify\nthe trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we\ncharacterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference\nand introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection\nframework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On\nMOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with\nfalse-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for\nadversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending\nagainst model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can\nbe achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.",

We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)\nto address these issues.

    "abstract": "The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)\nhas thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide\nrange of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN\ndesign and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available\nfunctionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After\nadopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to\nanother if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are\nintroduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is\nchallenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for\nNNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual\nupdates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure\ncompatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to\nautomatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our\nmethod makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior\nto migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely\nPyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code\nbetween the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.\nExperimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully\nmigrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the\noriginals.

Yet, the\nlocal computational principles which are required to enable this function\nremain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information\nprocessing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory\n- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new\ndesign principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new\nassociative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.",

    "abstract": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most\nsuccessful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and\neffectiveness across a range of problems.\n  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and\nbehavior policies to move to the \"right\" direction -- starting from importance\nsampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive\nadvantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions. However, due to randomness in\nthe rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the\nratios frequently move to the \"wrong\" direction during the PPO optimization.\nThis is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely\noverlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a\nsteeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that\nDClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing\non modifying the objective's behavior in the \"right\" direction, across various\nMuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is\nshown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid \"wrong\" direction\nupdates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian\noptimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given\ndataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from\nclassical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for\ncomputer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO\nstill sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its\nblack-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches\nhave been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,\nthese approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization\nprocess. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated\ninterventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user\npreferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.\nTo this end, we generalize an existing method, $\\pi$BO, preserving theoretical\nguarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows\nprotection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,\nleveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected\nor overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced\nby out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop\na simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\n(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.\nEmpirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL\nbenchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited\ndata.",

    "abstract": "We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --\nthe fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under\nsingle-variable random interventions and an $\\epsilon$-interventional\nfaithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales\nas $p_e = \\Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at\nrate $O(\\frac{\\log d}{\\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the\nexpected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This\nconcentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in\nlarge-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\\'asi--Albert\ngraphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies\n$\\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\\beta - \\frac{1}{2}})$ with\n$\\beta = 1/(\\gamma - 1) < \\frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit.

Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m.

NOWS\nleaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating\nseamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,\nfinite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization\nconsistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a\nreduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the\nstability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By\ncombining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional\nsolvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate\nhigh-fidelity PDE simulations.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for\nrepresentation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We\nprovide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing\nthat this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to\ncomprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,\nwe prove that the spherical geometry creates an \"inherently hard negative\nsampling\" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the\nmodel to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our\nfindings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an\nimplementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for\ngeometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful\nand stable KGE models.",

This\nheterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the\ngeneralizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We\npresent MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias\nquantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,\nimage processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies\nmetadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive\nreview of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography\ndatasets to systematically identify key sources of bias.

Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive.

We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data.

To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing\nweb services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web\necosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have\nrecently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak\nstrategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract\nvaluable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and\ncontains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient\nstrategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and\nmodular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that\nautonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve\nmore efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we\ndesign a closed-loop \"attack-evaluate-distill-reuse\" core mechanism that not\nonly generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes\nreusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate\nand apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library\nthat categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on\ntheir performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise\nguidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and\ntransferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,\nand the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)\nof 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial\nand temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor\ngeneralization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in\ndynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent\nnon-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish\nspatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in\nnon-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority\nof EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution\nshifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the\ndynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution\nperspective.",

    "abstract": "Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling\nefficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target\ndistributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often\nsufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has\nexplored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as\ncomponents of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical\nstudies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling\nefficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt\ntheir architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC\nsimilarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose\na factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by\ncombining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to\ntarget geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are\napproximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional\nNF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail\nsamples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better\nperformance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood\nand prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on\nhierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel\ngeometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and\nsoftware strides in neural MCMC design.",

However, most existing approaches\nare developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability\nto generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major\nobstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts\nframework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes\nproblem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The\nmodel is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization\nstrategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and\nintra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task\nembeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's\ngeneralization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance\nwithin each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general\nintrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on\nthree domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five\ndiverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot\nsetting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on\nchallenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often\nstruggle to generalize.",

To this end,\nvarious machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate\nstate transition\n  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed\ntraining\n  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth\nstate sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nmethod that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian\nffltering methods, enabling\n  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics\ndirectly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.\nSpeciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation\nof surrogate model parameters\n  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a\ndiscretetime\n  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate\ntransition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which\ncan be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the\nmodel is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage\nusing ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework\naccommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and\npartially observed measurement\n  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.",

In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\\\"older smooth\nfunctions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)\nfunctions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For\n(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding\ngradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates\nbetween the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our\nalgorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\\\"older smoothness parameter,\nexhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch\nconversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal\nuniversal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\\\"older smoothness.\nHowever, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more\nchallenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a\ndetection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a\nuniversal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth\nregime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.",

This coarse-grained resource management\nleads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to\npoor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.\n  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of\ngenerative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.\nThrough detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that\noperators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit\ndiverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,\nsequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the\noperator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling\ndecisions.\n  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources\nat finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and\nplacement based on individual operator profiles.

In order to\nunderstand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as\nexpected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries\nto probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple\nLLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts.

As a baseline study, we perform two case studies\non inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation\nLLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's\nKappa $\\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs\nyield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and\nraces.

    "abstract": "Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible\nlearning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the\nStructurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel\ncomputational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the\nmorphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates\non a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local\nprediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning\nmechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the\ntemporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned\nexpectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically\nmigrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This\ndual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information\n(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources\n(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole\nreinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture\ncan successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The\nnetwork's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis\nwas sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while\ncontinual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after\nachieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes\npost-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks\nmaintained an average 82% success rate.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios\nlike vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This\ngap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,\nshaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences\n(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling\nand semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling\nhuman-centric decisions.

In practice, observational data are often\nmissing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission\nissues.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction\naccuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate\nrobustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of\nextraneous variables.

These patterns\nsystematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level\nproducer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained\ndataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from\nthe foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the\ncomplex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end\nlatency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and\nefficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.",

This paper\nintroduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.\nBuilt upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework\nsupports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,\nranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts\nover those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing\narbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal\nproofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)\nsystematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)\nautomatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level\nguarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study\non an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor\nfusion.

    "abstract": "Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further\ninformation to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs), as structured knowledge bases that organize\nrelational information across diverse domains, provide a unified semantic\nfoundation for cross-domain recommendation (CDR). By integrating symbolic\nknowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,\nsupport reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,\nexisting KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly\nunder non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)\nsensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping\nusers for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between\ntransferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable\nknowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt\nlearning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under\nnon-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a\nKG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft\nprompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling\n(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain\npretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer\nwithout user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic\ncontrol with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly\nseparates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby\nmaintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning\n(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nKGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust\nunder varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating\nstructural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain\nrecommendation.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models\n(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets\nthrough conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a\ncentralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing\nprobabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m.

    "abstract": "Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for\nagricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires\nlarge annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic\ndata can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images\nremains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural\ngeneration of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated\ndatasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and\ncamera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on\nsynthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our\nresults show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of\n10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data\ndemonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in\ncross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic\nagricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model\ntraining.",

This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in\ncomplex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and\nhigh-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we\npropose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a\ncamera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide\nhigh-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint\nstructure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated\ncasting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,\nwhich enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface\nshape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,\nthe sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,\nadding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive\nexperiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and\nsoft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad\napplicability of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and\ndistributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for\ncontrolling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using\nPyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical\nbudgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators.",

    "abstract": "Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete\nmissions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are\nparticularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in\nthree categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface\nvehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,\nand a competitive game of capture the flag.",

In traditional regression tasks,\nmean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for\nnon-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust\nloss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of\nthe residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust\nformulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains\nstable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss\nreshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted\nisometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels\nat handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.\nThis work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine\nlearning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and\nbroadly applicable analytical framework.",

    "abstract": "Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate\ndisaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations\nin the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to\nunderstand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence\nacross wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human\ndecision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance\npurchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs\nis evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they\nfall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this\nlimitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules\nincluding perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.\nThe retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground\ndecisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal\nand bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to\nextrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is\nintractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation\nof temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life\ntrajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral\nmodeling and policy analysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that\ndirectly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human\nvalues or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three\nseparate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of\na core feature of alignment.",

    "abstract": "Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile\nnature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the\nperformance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown\nthat they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We\nimplemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments\nwith three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The\nresults shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as\nwell as its limitations.",

    "abstract": "Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for\nassigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in\ndataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure\nthat requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,\nmaking it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric\nalternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each\ndatapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how\nmuch it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective\ndimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the\ndummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending\nthem to \\emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains\nthat connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We\nfurther show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose\nparameters and predictive risk are within $O(\\varepsilon)$ of the full-data\noptimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and\ndownstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment\nin which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms\nstandard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.",

Fusion data shows non-stationary\nbehavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and\nmachine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to\nmaintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.\nOnline learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has\nbeen largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an\napplication of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream\nfor prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion\nfacility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain\nML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.\nMoreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance\ndegradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As\nsuch, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further\nimprove the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)\ntechnique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the\nuncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces\npredictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of\nhistorical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the\npredictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed\nuncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and\n10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.",

Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd\nTracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)\ndepth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)\nglobal and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by\ncomparing \"skin-to-bone\" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot\nmodels, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target\ntrials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap\nharvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per\ntrial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced\nand CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,\n1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by\nanatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm\ncoverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed\nsignificantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,\nmarkerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,\nand lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical\nclinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization\nplus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or\nlow-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR\nguidance.",

In terms of computational\ntime, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),\nmaking it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).\nContrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate\nimprovements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling\neffort compared to traditional U-Net.",

As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM.

Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive\nand even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks,\nincluding 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D\noccupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion\nprediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning).

However, depth ambiguity and\nerrors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous\nstudies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by\nconstraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the\nglobal spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this\nproblem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid\nfeature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain.\nSpecifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a\nTransformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The\nHGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group\nto enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover\nthe latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global\ntemporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency\ndomain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and\nmaintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the\n3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark\ndatasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nHGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional\naccuracy and temporal consistency.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are notoriously vulnerable to imperceptible\nperturbations. Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),\nwhich evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of\ndeterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness\n(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that\npredictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely\nregarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for\nimproving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.\nAmong the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i\nnon-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT\nbaselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to\ncompare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the\nfirst benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by\ndifferent robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common\nAT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,\nincluding clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and\ngeneralization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR\nperformance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by\nPRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training\nmethods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse\nhyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield\nlower GE and higher clean accuracy.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language\ninstructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an\nembodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques\nthat optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and\nSimplerEnv with 4$\\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world\nevaluations.

    "abstract": "Compared to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) not\nonly maintains the structural features of tissue samples, but also provides\nhigh-resolution protein localization, which is essential for aiding in\npathology diagnosis. Despite its diagnostic value, IHC remains a costly and\nlabor-intensive technique. Its limited scalability and constraints in\nmultiplexing further hinder widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited\nsettings. Consequently, researchers are increasingly exploring computational\nstain translation techniques to synthesize IHC-equivalent images from\nH&E-stained slides, aiming to extract protein-level information more\nefficiently and cost-effectively. However, most existing stain translation\ntechniques rely on a linearly weighted summation of multiple loss terms within\na single objective function, strategy that often overlooks the interdepedence\namong these components-resulting in suboptimal image quality and an inability\nto simultaneously preserve structural authenticity and color fidelity. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel network architecture that follows a\nprogressive structure, incorporating color and cell border generation logic,\nwhich enables each visual aspect to be optimized in a stage-wise and decoupled\nmanner. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, we\nbuild upon the Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP) framework as our baseline. We\nintroduce additional loss functions based on 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)\nchromogen concentration and image gradient, enhancing color fidelity and cell\nboundary clarity in the generated IHC images.

However, as they are typically optimized in\nsemantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness\nin visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed\nhighlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with\nUniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings\nRGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the\nmodel with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly\nalign lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical\nplausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for\nsupervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising\ncomputationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency\nlearning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training\nregimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a\nstructured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination\nattributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled\nattribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large\nvision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of\nrelighting precision across individual dimensions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with\nsignificantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for\nboth image and video relighting.

However, directly applying existing\nRL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the\nobjective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it\nplaces greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,\nthrough extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an\neffective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,\ninstead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been\noptimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks.

    "abstract": "In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is\na long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as\nvideos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on\nrank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce\nthe S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image\ngrid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video\ncandidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic\nSystem powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home\nrobots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents:\na visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from\nenvironment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing\nhazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an\nevaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception\nwith hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive,\nrisk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments.\nExperiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance\nof the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent\nexecution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models.

    "abstract": "The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal\nlarge model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the\ndichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous\ntokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple\nindependently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers\nfrom complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead.\nConversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by\nquantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information\nloss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the\nbinary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of\nlight, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).\nWe treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from\nquantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number\nassigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its\ncomplexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete\ntokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous\ntokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative\nPrimitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate\ninformation space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample\ncomplexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on\nreconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior\nperformance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result\nwithin a concise and scalable MLLM.",

    "abstract": "Embedding models are a cornerstone of modern AI. Driven by Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data\ncuration, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, i.e., single\ninput, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich,\nmultifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM\ncapabilities. In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF)\nfor multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of\nMLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response\nunder explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone\non distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one\ninput, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote\nfull parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an\nexplicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain\nsemantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic\ncoverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable\nembedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass,\nincurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple\nMLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains\nare consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g.,\nboosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the\nVLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B).

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models.

For real finite complex systems formed by\ncountable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species,\ndictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \\sim r^{-\\alpha}$ between\ntype count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely\nobserved to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is\nHeaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the\ntotal number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose\nan idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces\narbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to\ndetermine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument\nimproves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic\nexpression for all values of $\\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of\n$\\alpha = 1$ and $\\alpha \\gg 1$.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of\nsub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match\nqueries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures\nfine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent\nselection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that\nembeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects\nthem through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool\ncapabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent\nRetrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that\nagents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented\nwithout the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together.\nEvaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach\nachieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over\nprevious state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.",

To address these issues, we present IMO-Bench, a suite of advanced\nreasoning benchmarks, vetted by a panel of top specialists and that\nspecifically targets the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad\n(IMO), the most prestigious venue for young mathematicians. IMO-AnswerBench\nfirst tests models on 400 diverse Olympiad problems with verifiable short\nanswers. IMO-Proof Bench is the next-level evaluation for proof-writing\ncapabilities, which includes both basic and advanced IMO level problems as well\nas detailed grading guidelines to facilitate automatic grading. These\nbenchmarks played a crucial role in our historic achievement of the gold-level\nperformance at IMO 2025 with Gemini Deep Think (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Our\nmodel achieved 80.0% on IMO-AnswerBench and 65.7% on the advanced IMO-Proof\nBench, surpassing the best non-Gemini models by large margins of 6.9% and 42.4%\nrespectively. We also showed that autograders built with Gemini reasoning\ncorrelate well with human evaluations and construct IMO-GradingBench, with 1000\nhuman gradings on proofs, to enable further progress in automatic evaluation of\nlong-form answers.

    "abstract": "Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient\nkey-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation\nturns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and\nchat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or\nforce recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that\ncompresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on\nclassical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation,\nadaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial\ncalibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies\nin KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\\times$ compression while maintaining\nreasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\\times$ or higher for specific use\ncases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across\nbenchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and\nMATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token\neviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher\ncompression ratios.

This paper\npresents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control\nwithout model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate\nplanning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model\nto carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive\nevaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard\nprompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for\nshorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying\nbenefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating\nup to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal\nthat our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to\nstandard prompting techniques.

    "abstract": "Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as\nbrainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors. Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly\nmalleable: GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds\nof discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows\na 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing\nposition. We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that\nrequire tool use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief.\nWe find that these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that\nbelief shifts will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our\nanalysis exposes the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended\nsessions of talking or reading, rendering their opinions and actions\nunreliable.",

    "abstract": "Open-ended generation tasks require outputs to satisfy diverse and often\nimplicit task-specific evaluation rubrics. The sheer number of relevant rubrics\nleads to prohibitively high verification costs and incomplete assessments of a\nresponse, making reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with rubric-based\nrewards difficult to scale. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often\nthe best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly\nprompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic\n(RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic\nrubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a\ncritic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a\nfactual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external\nvalidator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the\ngenerator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and\nthe generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation\nand correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive\nverification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more\neffective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL\npost-training to free-form generation tasks.",

Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,\ntypically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a\nbinary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction,\nsuch as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2\nprojection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately\nand use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across\nlonger NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight\ninstruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly\nrepresented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2\nformulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align\nstrongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and\nChain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing\nPK reliance.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to specialized,\nhigh-stakes domains like engineering, which demands rigorous evaluation of\ntheir complex reasoning capabilities. While current benchmarks assess language\nunderstanding, factual recall, mathematics or code generation, none capture the\nintegrative reasoning central to engineering where scientific principles,\nquantitative modeling and practical constraints must converge. To address this\ngap, we introduce EngChain, a benchmark for verifiable multi-step engineering\nproblem-solving. EngChain contains 90 problems spanning three engineering\nbranches, organized into 9 domains and 20 distinct areas. The problems are\ngenerated from symbolic templates with a high degree of randomization to ensure\ndiversity and eliminate the risk of contamination. With this benchmark, we move\nbeyond final answer accuracy with a two-stage evaluation: we first\nquantitatively verify the numerical and semantic validity of each reasoning\nstep and then introduce LLM-As-A-Judge, an automated system to qualitatively\ncategorize the identified reasoning errors.",

However, it remains unclear whether\nthese models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required\nfor robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key\nrequirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce\nViewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset,\nconsisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and\ncorresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline\nMLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in\nsignificant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is\nenhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we\nintroduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously\nlearn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking.\nExperimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial\nreasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing\nfoundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics,\nautonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.",

    "abstract": "Linguistic errors are not merely deviations from normative grammar; they\noffer a unique window into the cognitive architecture of language and expose\nthe current limitations of artificial systems that seek to replicate them. This\nproject proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by\nnative Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language\nmodels (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project\ncontributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but\nalso to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and\ncapable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of\nreal human language.",

This study employs a\nframework based on behavioural forma mentis networks (i.e. cognitive models\nthat map how individuals structure their associative knowledge and emotional\nperceptions of concepts) to explore individual and group differences in the\nperception and association of concepts related to math and anxiety. We\nconducted 4 experiments involving psychology undergraduates from 2 samples (n1\n= 70, n2 = 57) compared against GPT-simulated students (GPT-3.5: n2 = 300;\nGPT-4o: n4 = 300). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 employ individual-level network\nfeatures to predict psychometric scores for math anxiety and its facets\n(observational, social and evaluational) from the Math Anxiety Scale.\nExperiment 4 focuses on group-level perceptions extracted from human students,\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4o's networks. Results indicate that, in students, positive\nvalence ratings and higher network degree for \"anxiety\", together with negative\nratings for \"math\", can predict higher total and evaluative math anxiety. In\ncontrast, these models do not work on GPT-based data because of differences in\nsimulated networks and psychometric scores compared to humans. These results\nwere also reconciled with differences found in the ways that high/low subgroups\nof simulated and real students framed semantically and emotionally STEM\nconcepts. High math-anxiety students collectively framed \"anxiety\" in an\nemotionally polarising way, absent in the negative perception of low\nmath-anxiety students. \"Science\" was rated positively, but contrasted against\nthe negative perception of \"math\". These findings underscore the importance of\nunderstanding concept perception and associations in managing students' math\nanxiety.",

    "abstract": "Text-based automated Cognitive Distortion detection is a challenging task due\nto its subjective nature, with low agreement scores observed even among expert\nhuman annotators, leading to unreliable annotations. We explore the use of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) as consistent and reliable annotators, and propose\nthat multiple independent LLM runs can reveal stable labeling patterns despite\nthe inherent subjectivity of the task. Furthermore, to fairly compare models\ntrained on datasets with different characteristics, we introduce a\ndataset-agnostic evaluation framework using Cohen's kappa as an effect size\nmeasure. This methodology allows for fair cross-dataset and cross-study\ncomparisons where traditional metrics like F1 score fall short. Our results\nshow that GPT-4 can produce consistent annotations (Fleiss's Kappa = 0.78),\nresulting in improved test set performance for models trained on these\nannotations compared to those trained on human-labeled data.

To address this limitation, we propose\n\\textbf{Budget-Aware Reasoning Distillation (BARD)}, a novel framework that\nsimultaneously distills reasoning capability and enables fine-grained control\nover the reasoning length. BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified\ncontrol signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance\nand computational efficiency. To achieve this concept, BARD introduces a\ntwo-phase training regimen. The first phase, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on\nteacher-generated long CoT data compressed to various budget levels,\nbootstrapping the model's understanding of budget constraints. The second phase\nleverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) from a reward signal in consideration of\nreasoning performance and budget fidelity simultaneously. Incorporating the\ntwo-phase regimen is crucial to avoiding policy degradation and ensuring that\nboth objectives are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method empowers an 8B student model to achieve strong performance on\nchallenging reasoning benchmarks (\\textit{AIME24, AIME25, GPQA}) while\nproviding precise and adaptive control over its reasoning length across a wide\nrange of budgets.",

Next, we re-assess\nthree hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative\nlanguages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at\nmorphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset\nsize. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we\nintroduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of\ncausal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for\nmorphological complexity that do not require expert annotation.

Answering\nexpert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of\npages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific\napproaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve\ncross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs,\na RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three\nmetadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB\n(line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents).\nDeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving\nreferenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution\nby mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design\nrationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world\nquestions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350\nevolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across\nmultiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art\ntelecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution\nand evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality,\nunderscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G\nstandards.",

In this work, we present an early systematic investigation into\nthis emerging threat. We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack,\nwhich employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which\noptimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize\nits effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently\ninducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers.\nFurthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To\ncounter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense.

    "abstract": "We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single\nattribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving\nintellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal\ndimensions: \\textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual\ndistinctiveness from its neighbors, and \\textit{temporal novelty}, which\ncaptures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize\nthese concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation\nmetrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature.\nApplying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a\nfundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different\noutcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial\nnovelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a\ntypology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with\ndistinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty\ncan be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms,\nreflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally\ndistinct consequences for scientific progress.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that\nincorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to\nsignificant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely\non coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or\nmisaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture\nsalient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal\nfusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should\nbalance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities,\npreserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper\npresents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework\nthat enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A\nVLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided\ndescriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned\nrepresentations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals\nacross modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon\ndatasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal\nbaselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.",

    "abstract": "In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is\na long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as\nvideos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on\nrank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work\nintroduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that\nre-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content\nevidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the\nmodel to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic\ncontent. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the\nchallenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce\nthe S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image\ngrid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video\ncandidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it\ndramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an\nensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nCombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the\nframework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals\nalongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%\n(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive\ngains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We\npresent ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning\nmodern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers.

    "abstract": "Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective\nparadigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It\ngenerally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers\n(IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID\ntokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with\nstrong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties:\nsimilar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should\nmaintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native\ncategory information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we\npropose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document\nIDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the\nsemantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class\nConstraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during\nquantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token\ndistribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed\ndocuments. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar\ndocuments more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents'\nrepresentations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in\naverage orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for\nlong-tail queries.",

A genetic\nsearch optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics\n(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic\nsimilarity).

RAGSmith finds\nconfigurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\\% on\naverage (range +1.2\\% to +6.9\\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\\% in\nretrieval and +7.5\\% in generation.

    "abstract": "Mathematical expressions (MEs) have complex two-dimensional structures in\nwhich symbols can be present at any nested depth like superscripts, subscripts,\nabove, below etc. As MEs are represented using LaTeX format, several text\nretrieval methods based on string matching, vector space models etc., have also\nbeen applied for ME retrieval problem in the literature. As these methods are\nbased on syntactic similarity, recently deep learning approaches based on\nembedding have been used for semantic similarity. In our present work, we have\nfocused on the retrieval of mathematical expressions using deep learning\napproaches. In our approach, semantic features are extracted from the MEs using\na deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and these features have been used for\nmatching and retrieval. We have trained the network for a classification task\nwhich determines the complexity of an ME. ME complexity has been quantified in\nterms of its nested depth. Based on the nested depth, we have considered three\ncomplexity classes of MEs: Simple, Medium and Complex. After training the\nnetwork, outputs just before the the final fully connected layer are extracted\nfor all the MEs. These outputs form the semantic features of MEs and are stored\nin a database. For a given ME query, its semantic features are computed using\nthe trained DRNN and matched against the semantic feature database. Matching is\nperformed based on the standard euclidean distance and top 'k' nearest matches\nare retrieved, where 'k' is a user-defined parameter. Our approach has been\nillustrated on a database of 829 MEs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping numerous facets of our daily\nlives, leading widespread adoption as web-based services. Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).",

    "abstract": "Reranking algorithms have made progress in improving document retrieval\nquality by efficiently aggregating relevance judgments generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, identifying relevant documents for queries\nthat require in-depth reasoning remains a major challenge. Reasoning-intensive\nqueries often exhibit multifaceted information needs and nuanced\ninterpretations, rendering document relevance inherently context dependent. To\naddress this, we propose contextual relevance, which we define as the\nprobability that a document is relevant to a given query, marginalized over the\ndistribution of different reranking contexts it may appear in (i.e., the set of\ncandidate documents it is ranked alongside and the order in which the documents\nare presented to a reranking model). While prior works have studied methods to\nmitigate the positional bias LLMs exhibit by accounting for the ordering of\ndocuments, we empirically find that the compositions of these batches also\nplays an important role in reranking performance. To efficiently estimate\ncontextual relevance, we propose TS-SetRank, a sampling-based,\nuncertainty-aware reranking algorithm. Empirically, TS-SetRank improves nDCG@10\nover retrieval and reranking baselines by 15-25% on BRIGHT and 6-21% on BEIR,\nhighlighting the importance of modeling relevance as context-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual\nlearning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when\ntrained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated\nframework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)\ntheory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson\nconfidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple\nmetrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost\nof 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the\nbaseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to\nstate-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers\nare predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of\na critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note\nthat the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the\nsequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The\nframework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical\nguarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks.

We use this methodology\nto create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous\npipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales.

    "abstract": "Robotic grasping under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge due to its\nuncertain and contact-rich nature. Traditional rigid robotic hands, with\nlimited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and\nheavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by\ncontrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated\nstructures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate\nuncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability,\nwe propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers\ndistributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping,\ndirectly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model\n(Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using\nonly 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned\npolicy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace,\ngeneralizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable\nperformance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling\nthe execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that\nactuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and\nflexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence\nand substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this\nuncertain-rich task.",

Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism.

However, most methods\ntreat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or\nexcluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs\nlimit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability\nand robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative\ntreatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their\nrespective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given\nconsecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and\nimaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames\nare transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to\nimpose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,\nenabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the\njoint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each\ntranslation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric\nrelationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth\nrobustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework\nincorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\npublic datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly\nunder challenging conditions.

Although\nexisting methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain\nunresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the\nfloor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both\nlocal obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is\ncritical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in\nunseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB\ninputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as\nGlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local\ndepth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers\nexplicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric\ncues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions\nand robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation\nduring training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we\nfind that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference\nresults in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments\non the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in\nachieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world\ndeployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical\napplications.",

Our framework encodes natural language\ninstructions, task context, and safety constraints into a structured prompt\nthat guides the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning trace in natural\nlanguage. This reasoning output is used to select from a predefined library of\ndiscrete, flight-safe skills, ensuring interpretable and temporally consistent\nexecution. By decoupling symbolic reasoning from physical action, AERMANI-VLM\nmitigates hallucinated commands and prevents unsafe behavior, enabling robust\ntask completion.

We detail the\narchitecture of our system that integrates component-based design, a\ndata-oriented communication model using ROS2 and Zenoh, and a deployment\norchestrator capable of managing complex multi-module assemblies. These\nabstractions enable dynamic reconfiguration, decentralized control, and\nseamless collaboration between numerous operators and modules. At the heart of\nthis system lies our open-source Motion Stack software, validated by months of\nfield deployment with self-assembling robots, inter-robot cooperation, and\nremote operation. Our architecture tackles the significant hurdles of modular\nrobotics by significantly reducing integration and maintenance overhead, while\nremaining scalable and robust. Although tested with space in mind, we propose\ngeneralizable patterns for designing robotic systems that must scale across\ntime, hardware, teams and operational environments.",

    "abstract": "Object-Centric Motion Generation (OCMG) is instrumental in advancing\nautomated manufacturing processes, particularly in domains requiring\nhigh-precision expert robotic motions, such as spray painting and welding. To\nrealize effective automation, robust algorithms are essential for generating\nextended, object-aware trajectories across intricate 3D geometries. However,\ncontemporary OCMG techniques are either based on ad-hoc heuristics or employ\nlearning-based pipelines that are still reliant on sensitive post-processing\nsteps to generate executable paths. We introduce FoldPath, a novel, end-to-end,\nneural field based method for OCMG. Unlike prior deep learning approaches that\npredict discrete sequences of end-effector waypoints, FoldPath learns the robot\nmotion as a continuous function, thus implicitly encoding smooth output paths.\nThis paradigm shift eliminates the need for brittle post-processing steps that\nconcatenate and order the predicted discrete waypoints. Particularly, our\napproach demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to recently\nproposed learning-based methods, and attains generalization capabilities even\nin real industrial settings, where only a limited amount of 70 expert samples\nare provided. We validate FoldPath through comprehensive experiments in a\nrealistic simulation environment and introduce new, rigorous metrics designed\nto comprehensively evaluate long-horizon robotic paths, thus advancing the OCMG\ntask towards practical maturity.",

While the longitudinal velocity can be measured\nusing wheel encoders, the estimation of the lateral velocity remains a key\nchallenge due to the absence of dedicated sensors in consumer-grade vehicles.\nExisting approaches often rely on simplified vehicle models, such as the\nzero-slip model, which assumes no lateral velocity at the rear axle. It is well\nestablished that this assumption does not hold during low-speed driving and\nresearchers thus introduce additional heuristics to account for differences. In\nthis work, we analyze real-world data from parking scenarios and identify a\nsystematic deviation from the zero-slip assumption.

    "abstract": "The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) does not only serve as the textbook\nmodel for a carnivorous plant, but also has long intrigued both botanists and\nengineers with its rapidly closing leaf trap. The trap closure is triggered by\ntwo consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly\nswitch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the\nprey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With\nour research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion\nmechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe\nactuator. We identified geometrical characteristics, such as dimensional ratios\nand the thickness gradient in the lobe, and transferred these to two 3D-printed\nbistable actuator models. One actuator parallels the simulated geometry of a\nVenus flytrap leaf, the other is a lobe model designed with CAD. Both models\ndisplay concave-convex bi-stability and snap close. These demonstrators are the\nfirst step in the development of an artificial Venus flytrap that mimics the\nmechanical behavior of the biological model and can be used as a soft fast\ngripper.",

Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been\nextensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in\nconfined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots\nprimarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and\nease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky,\npower-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this\nwork, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot\nutilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating\npreconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play\nstyle modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external\nelectronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while\nmaintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under\ndifferent operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance.\nOur findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively\ngenerates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with\nminimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development\nof electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots.

    "abstract": "Dexterous grasp generation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring\nboth grasp stability and adaptability across diverse objects and tasks.\nAnalytical methods ensure stable grasps but are inefficient and lack task\nadaptability, while generative approaches improve efficiency and task\nintegration but generalize poorly to unseen objects and tasks due to data\nlimitations. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based framework for dexterous\ngrasp generation, leveraging a conditional diffusion model to transfer\nhigh-quality grasps from shape templates to novel objects within the same\ncategory. Specifically, we reformulate the grasp transfer problem as the\ngeneration of an object contact map, incorporating object shape similarity and\ntask specifications into the diffusion process. To handle complex shape\nvariations, we introduce a dual mapping mechanism, capturing intricate\ngeometric relationship between shape templates and novel objects. Beyond the\ncontact map, we derive two additional object-centric maps, the part map and\ndirection map, to encode finer contact details for more stable grasps. We then\ndevelop a cascaded conditional diffusion model framework to jointly transfer\nthese three maps, ensuring their intra-consistency. Finally, we introduce a\nrobust grasp recovery mechanism, identifying reliable contact points and\noptimizing grasp configurations efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of our proposed method. Our approach effectively balances grasp\nquality, generation efficiency, and generalization performance across various\ntasks. Project homepage: https://cmtdiffusion.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable\nruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical\nexamples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However,\npath planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant\nchallenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and\nrobust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots\n(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages\nhigh-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable\nplanning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window\nmechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for\nrapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle\nconfigurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the\nenvironment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path\nlength (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate\nSATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,\noutperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner\nreduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving\ncomparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of\nSATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.",

We introduce embodiment transfer\nlearning, denoted as ET-VLA, a novel framework for efficient and effective\ntransfer of pre-trained VLAs to multi-robot. ET-VLA's core is Synthetic\nContinued Pretraining (SCP), which uses synthetically generated data to warm up\nthe model for the new embodiment, bypassing the need for real human\ndemonstrations and reducing data collection costs. SCP enables the model to\nlearn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the\nmodel is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model\nperformance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought\ntechnique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that\nallows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each\nembodiment during task execution.

Four\ntraining methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.\nright-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model\npretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a\nmodel pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian\nhighways.

Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone\nworsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but\nsignificantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to\nlower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this\napproach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on\nResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends.

To this end, we represent different\nembodiments (e.g., human hands and robot hands) as sets of 3D particles and\ndefine actions as particle displacements, creating a shared representation for\nheterogeneous data and control problems. A graph-based world model is then\ntrained on exploration data from diverse simulated robot hands and real human\nhands, and integrated with model-based planning for deployment on novel\nhardware. Experiments on rigid and deformable manipulation tasks reveal three\nfindings: (i) scaling to more training embodiments improves generalization to\nunseen ones, (ii) co-training on both simulated and real data outperforms\ntraining on either alone, and (iii) the learned models enable effective control\non robots with varied degrees of freedom. These results establish world models\nas a promising interface for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an enhanced proprioceptive method for accurate shape\nestimation of soft robots using only off-the-shelf sensors, ensuring\ncost-effectiveness and easy applicability. By integrating inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs) with complementary bend sensors, IMU drift is mitigated, enabling\nreliable long-term proprioception. A Kalman filter fuses segment tip\norientations from both sensors in a mutually compensatory manner, improving\nshape estimation over single-sensor methods. A piecewise constant curvature\nmodel estimates the tip location from the fused orientation data and\nreconstructs the robot's deformation. Experiments under no loading, external\nforces, and passive obstacle interactions during 45 minutes of continuous\noperation showed a root mean square error of 16.96 mm (2.91% of total length),\na 56% reduction compared to IMU-only benchmarks. These results demonstrate that\nour approach not only enables long-duration proprioception in soft robots but\nalso maintains high accuracy and robustness across these diverse conditions.",

In this work, we propose Shortcut\nLearning for Abstract Planning (SLAP), a method that leverages existing TAMP\noptions to automatically discover new ones. Our key idea is to use model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) to learn shortcuts in the abstract planning graph\ninduced by the existing options in TAMP. Without any additional assumptions or\ninputs, shortcut learning leads to shorter solutions than pure planning, and\nhigher task success rates than flat and hierarchical RL.

    "abstract": "Real-time tracking of dynamic targets amidst large-scale, high-frequency\ndisturbances remains a critical unsolved challenge in Robotic Ultrasound\nSystems (RUSS), primarily due to the end-to-end latency of existing systems.\nThis paper argues that breaking this latency barrier requires a fundamental\nshift towards the synergistic co-design of perception and control. We realize\nit in a novel framework with two tightly-coupled contributions: (1) a Decoupled\nDual-Stream Perception Network that robustly estimates 3D translational state\nfrom 2D images at high frequency, and (2) a Single-Step Flow Policy that\ngenerates entire action sequences in one inference pass, bypassing the\niterative bottleneck of conventional policies. This synergy enables a\nclosed-loop control frequency exceeding 60Hz. On a dynamic phantom, our system\nnot only tracks complex 3D trajectories with a mean error below 6.5mm but also\ndemonstrates robust re-acquisition from over 170mm displacement. Furthermore,\nit can track targets at speeds of 102mm/s, achieving a terminal error below\n1.7mm. Moreover, in-vivo experiments on a human volunteer validate the\nframework's effectiveness and robustness in a realistic clinical setting. Our\nwork presents a RUSS holistically architected to unify high-bandwidth tracking\nwith large-scale repositioning, a critical step towards robust autonomy in\ndynamic clinical environments.",

The\nkey challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data.\nCurrent recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information\nwhile neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also\nrely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics),\nresulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences,\nparticularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these\napproaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items,\nlimiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these\nchallenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal\nrecommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into\nour model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance\nstructural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph\nstructure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items.\nMeanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals\nenhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the\nrepresentational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous\nbenchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent\non the Sports dataset.

    "abstract": "Forecasting multi-step user behavior trajectories requires reasoning over\nstructured preferences across future actions, a challenge overlooked by\ntraditional sequential recommendation. This problem is critical for\napplications such as personalized commerce and adaptive content delivery, where\nanticipating a user's complete action sequence enhances both satisfaction and\nbusiness outcomes. We identify an essential limitation of existing paradigms:\ntheir inability to capture global, listwise dependencies among sequence items.\nTo address this, we formulate User Behavior Trajectory Prediction (UBTP) as a\nnew task setting that explicitly models long-term user preferences. We\nintroduce Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization (LPDO), a diffusion-based\ntraining framework that directly optimizes structured preferences over entire\nitem sequences. LPDO incorporates a Plackett-Luce supervision signal and\nderives a tight variational lower bound aligned with listwise ranking\nlikelihoods, enabling coherent preference generation across denoising steps and\novercoming the independent-token assumption of prior diffusion methods. To\nrigorously evaluate multi-step prediction quality, we propose the task-specific\nmetric Sequential Match (SeqMatch), which measures exact trajectory agreement,\nand adopt Perplexity (PPL), which assesses probabilistic fidelity. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world user behavior benchmarks demonstrate that LPDO\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new\nbenchmark for structured preference learning with diffusion models.",

Recent years have seen rapid\nadvances across many of these areas, but research efforts remain fragmented\nacross communities and frequently exclude practitioners. The purpose of this\nworkshop is to create an environment where all aspects of late interaction can\nbe discussed, with a focus on early research explorations, real-world outcomes,\nand negative or puzzling results to be freely shared and discussed.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used for enhancing the performance\nof graph collaborative filtering (GCF) for personalized recommendation. Since\ndata augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works\nhave designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users\nand items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the\nambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core\ninformation and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall\ncomplexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR\noutperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics. SCAR\nexhibits strong robustness across different hyperparameter settings and is\nparticularly effective in sparse data scenarios.",

    "abstract": "As various 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been\nintroduced to the market, research on multi-session simultaneous localization\nand mapping (MSS) using heterogeneous LiDAR sensors has been actively\nconducted. Existing MSS methods mostly rely on loop closure detection for\ninter-session alignment; however, the performance of loop closure detection can\nbe potentially degraded owing to the differences in the density and field of\nview (FoV) of the sensors used in different sessions. In this study, we\nchallenge the existing paradigm that relies heavily on loop detection modules\nand propose a novel MSS framework, called Multi-Mapcher, that employs\nlarge-scale map-to-map registration to perform inter-session initial alignment,\nwhich is commonly assumed to be infeasible, by leveraging outlier-robust 3D\npoint cloud registration. Next, after finding inter-session loops by radius\nsearch based on the assumption that the inter-session initial alignment is\nsufficiently precise, anchor node-based robust pose graph optimization is\nemployed to build a consistent global map. As demonstrated in our experiments,\nour approach shows substantially better MSS performance for various LiDAR\nsensors used to capture the sessions and is faster than state-of-the-art\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Integrating generative models with action chunking has shown significant\npromise in imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, the existing\ndiffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal\ndependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating\nproprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the\npolicy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually\nderived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across\nsix RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion\npolicy by an average of 14.6\\%. On three real-world robotic manipulation tasks,\nit achieves a 15.0\\% improvement. Code: https://github.com/dianyeHuang/D3P.",

    "abstract": "Bipedal balance is challenging due to its multi-phase, hybrid nature and\nhigh-dimensional state space. Traditional balance control approaches for\nbipedal robots rely on low-dimensional models for locomotion planning and\nreactive control, constraining the full robot to behave like these simplified\nmodels. This involves tracking preset reference paths for the Center of Mass\nand upper body obtained through low-dimensional models, often resulting in\ninefficient walking patterns with bent knees. However, we observe that bipedal\nbalance is inherently low-dimensional and can be effectively described with\nsimple state and action descriptors in a low-dimensional state space. This\nallows the robot's motion to evolve freely in its high-dimensional state space,\nonly constraining its projection in the low-dimensional state space. In this\nwork, we propose a novel control approach that avoids prescribing a\nlow-dimensional model to the full model. Instead, our control framework uses a\ndescriptive model with the minimum degrees of freedom necessary to maintain\nbalance, allowing the remaining degrees of freedom to evolve freely in the\nhigh-dimensional space.

Conventional MOT\nmethods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily\nunder these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space,\nand identity ambiguity under a 360{\\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a\nfeedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory\ncues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly\nalleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations,\nFlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization\nand reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an\nExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts\ndesign, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift.\nFinally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end\nand tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a\nbalanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous\nevaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for\npanoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and\nBipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot.

The main contributions are listed as follows:\n(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic\nmanipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that\njointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert\nduring training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory\ndata with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D\nperceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the\nVLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,\nderived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment\nmanipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured\ndiscrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of\ncontinuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual\nsupervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,\nenabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental\nresults on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our\nframe-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves\ncompetitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.\nFurthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset\nto support future research in the community",

Modern vehicles typically use strapdown systems, such that\ngyro integration requires coning compensation to account for the sensor's\nrotation during the integration. Many coning compensation algorithms have been\ndeveloped and a few are reviewed. This work introduces a new class of coning\ncorrection algorithm built directly from the classical Runge-Kutta integration\nroutines. A simple case is shown to collapse to one of the most popular coning\nalgorithms and a clear procedure for generating higher-order algorithms is\npresented.",

Traditional user profiling often overlooks the distinction between\ntransitory short-term interests and stable long-term preferences. This paper\nexamines the capability of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture\nthese temporal dynamics, generating richer user representations through\ndistinct short-term and long-term textual summaries of interaction histories.\nOur observations suggest that while LLMs tend to improve recommendation quality\nin domains with more active user engagement, their benefits appear less\npronounced in sparser environments. This disparity likely stems from the\nvarying distinguishability of short-term and long-term preferences across\ndomains; the approach shows greater utility where these temporal interests are\nmore clearly separable (e.g., Movies\\&TV) compared to domains with more stable\nuser profiles (e.g., Video Games). This highlights a critical trade-off between\nenhanced performance and computational costs, suggesting context-dependent LLM\napplication. Beyond predictive capability, this LLM-driven approach inherently\nprovides an intrinsic potential for interpretability through its natural\nlanguage profiles and attention weights.

There are lots of\nworks focusing on its application performance compared to extended Kalman\nfilter (EKF) but there is still a myth at the theoretical relationship between\nthe SW-FGO and EKF. In this paper, we find the necessarily fair condition to\nconnect SW-FGO and Kalman filter variants (KFV) (e.g., EKF, iterative EKF\n(IEKF), robust EKF (REKF) and robust iterative EKF (RIEKF)). Based on the\nconditions, we propose a recursive FGO (Re-FGO) framework to represent KFV\nunder SW-FGO formulation. Under explicit conditions (Markov assumption,\nGaussian noise with L2 loss, and a one-state window), Re-FGO regenerates\nexactly to EKF/IEKF/REKF/RIEKF, while SW-FGO shows measurable benefits in\nnonlinear, non-Gaussian regimes at a predictable compute cost. Finally, after\nclarifying the connection between them, we highlight the unique advantages of\nSW-FGO in practical phases, especially on numerical estimation and deep\nlearning integration.

We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace\nunrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the\nreliability of standard Kinarm parameters.\n  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control\nparticipants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the\nfirst 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,\nfine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We\nrecomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,\nposture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and\ncompared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).\n  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only\n8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded\nreaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA\nimprovements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials\nreplaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability.\n  Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR\nassessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5\nminutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This\nforecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for\nassessing motor impairments following stroke.",

During manipulation, humans actively\ncoordinate head and hand movements, continuously reposition their viewpoint and\nuse pre-action visual fixation search strategies to locate relevant objects.\nThese behaviors create dynamic, task-driven head motions that static robot\nsensing systems cannot replicate, leading to a significant distribution shift\nthat degrades policy performance. We present EgoMI (Egocentric Manipulation\nInterface), a framework that captures synchronized end-effector and active head\ntrajectories during manipulation tasks, resulting in data that can be\nretargeted to compatible semi-humanoid robot embodiments. To handle rapid and\nwide-spanning head viewpoint changes, we introduce a memory-augmented policy\nthat selectively incorporates historical observations. We evaluate our approach\non a bimanual robot equipped with an actuated camera head and find that\npolicies with explicit head-motion modeling consistently outperform baseline\nmethods.

However, it remains challenging\nto jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the\ninherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose\nDUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that\nhandles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while enabling\ncross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we propose training techniques such\nas independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow\nmatching loss, which enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a\nbidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space.\nFurthermore, based on the decoupled training framework, we introduce a sampling\nmethod where we sample action and vision tokens asynchronously at different\nrates, which shows improvement through inference-time scaling. Through\nexperiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up\nto 6% gains over a standard VLA baseline and implicit world-modeling methods,\nwith our inference-time scaling approach providing an additional 2-5% gain on\nsuccess rate. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST outperforms\nbaselines in success rate by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond\nsimulation. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DUST in large-scale\npretraining with action-free videos from BridgeV2, where DUST leads to\nsignificant gain when transferred to the RoboCasa benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into\npretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the\napplication of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains\nunderexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class\nsets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook\nthe inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring\nscenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task\nimages, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that\nprompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across\ntasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated\nby this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection\n(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD\nemploys networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate\nknowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD\nfurther engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments\non PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's\neffectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among\nexisting baselines.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in\ndomains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface\nmanipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.",

    "abstract": "Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding\ngreat promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they\ncould also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the\nrisk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous\ndata during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach\nremains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune\nthese models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \\eval, a\nframework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce\nthe dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \\eval assesses models'\nvirus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,\nmutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that\ncurrent filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded\nknowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits\nbroader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals\nmay already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via\nsimple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data\nfiltering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research\ninto robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation\nmodels.",

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height:\nElev\\.minimum, Elev\\.L3, lev\\.MAD.mode, Elev\\.mode, Elev\\.MAD\\.median, and\nElev\\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while\nLeaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and\nfull-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values\nestimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste\nprovince ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha.

    "abstract": "Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both\ncompact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These\nresults highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by\ntheir sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nunderstanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global\ncross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store\ntheir outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass\n(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically\nimplausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image\nanalysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated\ndatasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging\nmodalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that\npre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome\ndata scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.",

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by\nenabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from\nvisual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

However, these approaches often suffer from high\ncomputational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead\nto divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address\nthese issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium\ndynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar\nenergy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,\nEBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior\nunder distribution shifts.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human\nperformance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers\neither rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems\nsuch as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture\nthe decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some\ninadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be\nformally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee\nverifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic\ndecision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for\nfunctions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of\nLLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or\nreal-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)\ntests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill\ncause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score\n65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art\nLLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity\nincreases.

    "abstract": "To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the\nleakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated\nLearning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct\neffectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve\nsignificant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

The gap stems from two fundamental\nchallenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens\nthat is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,\nand (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens\nthat couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical\ntokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms\nto ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the\nattention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional\nencoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive\nparadigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first\nand then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for\nunconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP.

However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning\nsettings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW\noften yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)\nthe local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing\nmoment estimates ($\\boldsymbol{v}$, $\\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down\nconvergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first\n\\underline{Fed}erated \\underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \\texttt{FedAdamW},\nfor training and fine-tuning various large models. \\texttt{FedAdamW} aligns\nlocal updates with the global update using both a \\textbf{local correction\nmechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.\n\\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \\texttt{mean} of the second-moment\nestimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them.

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the\ncontent matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video\npair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic\nvariation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive.

Existing data-driven\napproaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task\ndemonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an\nuncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns\ntask-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE\nemploys probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and\nactively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action\nspace, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific\nsupervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a\ncontinuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with\nhybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the\nreal world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based\nreinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables\nsuperior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under\nsensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results\ndemonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,\nreusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing\na step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in\ncompliant robots.",

While existing methods that use supervised\nfine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can\nimprove efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper\nintroduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously\nenhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing\napproach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer\nresponses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult\nproblems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that\ndynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on\nthe model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient\nreasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory\nthought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the\nmodel to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing\nreasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds\nchallenging.

Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in\npreviously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)\nsteering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational\nalignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation\nwithout the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the\ncost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one\nhigh-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and\ncontrollable at minimal marginal cost.",

The core\nmechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of\ninformation theory.

This reward\ndesign enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or\nexternal reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated\nsimulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the\nchallenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,\nincluding ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across\nuser expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nNous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to\nvarying user expertise.

    "abstract": "The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication\nrounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the\neffectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several\nbaselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual\nknowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge\nstorage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing\nmethods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are\noften identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other\ncomponents, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.\nThis imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing\neffectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better\ngeneralization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further\nanalysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an\noptimal range across diverse settings.",

    "abstract": "Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human\nroad user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing\napproaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or\n'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack\nflexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor\nconstraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in\ninteractive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions.",

Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals,\nSNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more\nenergy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive\nanalysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional\nperformance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike\ncount, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient\ndescent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP),\nare examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs\nclosely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the\n20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve\ncompetitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation\nwindows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike\ncounts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making\nthem optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the\nsuitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive\napplications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems.

However, due to the inherently complex and diverse\nnature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning\nremains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an\nagentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal\nperception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context\ndegradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary\ncomponents: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response\nSynthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a \"telescope\", offering\nhigh-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to\naugment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external\ntools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer\nconsolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly\noutput. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,\nincluding VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up\nto +6.69% across all datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide\ninteresting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was\nmotivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics\noffering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and\nWeibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed\nanalysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and\ninterpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely\nopaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new\nclass of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The\nderived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more\ninterpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances\nare themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim\nregarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the\nmistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our\nfindings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and\ncontextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.",

In this work, we address this limitation by\nintroducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to\nexpress complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are\nassociated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)\nCoupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages\ncoupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM).

Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new\napproach for ultra-low bitrate image description.

To address this important issue, we propose to\nseamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint\ntext and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise\ngeneration of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent\nare both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image\nreconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while\nusing much less bandwidth.

While angiographic image\nanalysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying\ncardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality\ncan significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery\nSegmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline\ncomprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel\nmultichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham\nmethod provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by\n0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using\nthe techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network\nbuilt on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational\nNeural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of\nnarrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further\nsuppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a\ncombination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic\narteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an\nIoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%.

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability\nenables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM.

Without principled\nvalidation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified\nLaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable\njudgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various\nautomated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with\nhuman judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation\nstrategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled\nevaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a\nLaaJ aligns with human judgment.

SparseAlign\ncombines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment\nmetric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling\nreliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are\nineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied\ninternally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned\nevaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release\ndecisions.

Existing studies primarily adopt a\nsingle-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its\ninfluencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These\nefforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and\ninsufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper\nproposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates\nmulti-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial\nmorphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and\ncommunication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic\ncommunication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph\nAttention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal\nfeatures under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on\nexisting principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper\nintroduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training\nstrategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nachieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in\nmultimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint\noptimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83\n(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks.

This\ntemporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it\nlearns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical\nlearning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before\ncomplex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,\npractical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and\npredicting the onset of overfitting.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the\ndemand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior\nto individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing\nthe in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,\nincluding personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling\nemerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user\npatterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and\ninstance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level\ninterference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward\npass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical\ninnovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by\nhooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware\naggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant\nenhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,\nexcelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In\naddition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as\na plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.\nExtensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text\ngeneration, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and\ncompatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly\nenhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while\nmaintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.\nImplementation is available at https://github.com/KounianhuaDu/Fints.",

This collective contribution classifies\nthe state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS\nlifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic\nbackbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and\nconfiguration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and\ndigital twin as continuous feedback.

A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to\nnetwork- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling\nacross variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,\ntraining, compliance).

    "abstract": "Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous\nrobots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies\nand synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental\nresults indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing\nnear-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online\nsolver.",

To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage.

Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage\nprocess. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated\nusing a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison\nand quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark\nfor hallucination detection.

    "abstract": "Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.\nHowever, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they\nreach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss\nlandscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or\nprovides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor \"E\"\nfor gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue\nexploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)\nin order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a\nlocal minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and\nflatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We\nalso provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex\nand non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their\neffectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,\nlarge-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing\nresults show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy\n(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of\n2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially\nopens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual\nexperiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a\npromising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current\nmethods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world\napplicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain\nvisual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific\nadaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be\ndecomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging\nadversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to\nisolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This\ndisentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any\nadditional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA\nsignificantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance\ncomparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a\nscalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model\nweights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.",

Although AI survey chatbots\nimprove convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees\nor static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit\nindividual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.\nWe address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through\nReinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for\nAI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality\nusing a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and\nSpecificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy\nthat updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with\npriors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total\nchatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation\nacross 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual\nparticipants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12\nmean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over\nnon-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in\nspecification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior.

Although level generators and the\nproperties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability)\ndominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that\nemotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative\nand multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and\nmultimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose.\nHowever, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what\ndegree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output\nfor a generative system to target.\n  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a\nquantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level\ngenerators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis\ntractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed\nprompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several\nstandardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification\n(ESC-50) dataset.

    "abstract": "Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and\nentanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,\nmost existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or\nunitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While\ntheoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training\ninstability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By\njointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates\ncontrollable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative\ndynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties\nserve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets.

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities. We will release our code and models.",

    "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer\nscreening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack\nLDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer\ndetection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening\nTrial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of\n26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)\nradiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar\nmicrostructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly\nimprove early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning\nsegmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent\nsensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially\nimproves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation\nradiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose\nalternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is\nunavailable.",

    "abstract": "In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly\nenhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability\nof GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the\nWasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the\nperception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully\ndistilled into the sender.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image\nanalysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated\ndatasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging\nmodalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that\npre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome\ndata scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by\nenabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from\nvisual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their\ncore, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by\nstep until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This\nprocess gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.\nThe very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,\nimperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.\nSuch tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this\nvulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while\nleaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong\npredictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive\nHard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the\npower of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to\nenable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings\nfor the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster\ntogether in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same\nclass while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps\nthe model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient\ncues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and\nrobust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard\nadversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial\nguidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more\nstructured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and\nrobustness.",

Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

However, automated analysis of\nhistorical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide\nstylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data.

Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating\nbuildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying\nenvironmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for\nautomatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a\nvisual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with\nfew-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images\nand time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,\nenabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from\nsimilar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal\nfeatures. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time\nSeries Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time\nseries from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.\nExperimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively\nand can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited\nsupervision or using pseudo videos.

    "abstract": "The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid\ngrowth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This\ndemonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and\nmaintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.",

Second, code-based generation\nmethods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users\ninto the cumbersome cycle of \"writing-compiling-reviewing\" and lack the\nintuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet\nthe needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in\nscientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent\nframework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.\nVisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a\nToolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector\ngraphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be\nexplicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and\nany element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the\nquality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with\nseven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density\nscientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,\nand interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments\nto verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our\nevaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,\npresenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of\ntheir respective capabilities.

    "abstract": "Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where\nboth the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional\nmethods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches\ntypically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting\ntheir adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,\na zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that\nrequires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an\niterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and\nprogressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized\nneural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the\nblur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data\nconsistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation\nis our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and\nprovides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow\nDeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input\nimage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in\nhighly degraded scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the\ncontent matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video\npair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic\nvariation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic\ncollapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion\nmodels has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal\nconcerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing\ndeepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from\npoor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,\nwhich is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This\nstudy proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise\nresiduals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep\nlearning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\ntransformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF\nv2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines\nand demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nhybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.\nRobustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87\nat QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations\n(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and\nforensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82\npercent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm\nthat hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability\nof deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient\nand trustworthy deepfake detection systems.",

While angiographic image\nanalysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying\ncardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality\ncan significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery\nSegmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline\ncomprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel\nmultichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham\nmethod provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by\n0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using\nthe techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network\nbuilt on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational\nNeural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of\nnarrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further\nsuppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a\ncombination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic\narteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an\nIoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a\nrobust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable\ntool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in\ndiffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a\nnovel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial\ntraining to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood\nof sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of\nadversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this\nwork, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of\nconcept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept\nspace? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual\nsemantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting\nof concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there\nare few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object\nconcept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.\nMotivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE\n(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging\nsemantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and\nperform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art\nmethods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM\nunlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure\nperformance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training\ntime by 90%.

    "abstract": "Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential\ntechnique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological\nfoundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving\nmeaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.\nHowever, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity\ncaused by diverse private training datasets and different network\narchitectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we\nutilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To\nfully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we\npropose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,\ncalled FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The\nmain contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To\nguarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a\nmulti-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via\nmultiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\npatch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online\ncapture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\nslide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the\nconnections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung\ncancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an\nintractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a\nself-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a\nlearning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is\nguided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.\nGiven an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid\nmesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict\nthe motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted\nresult is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in\nthe input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate\ngeometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function\nincorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic\nobjects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain\nsimple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce\na clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates\nthe need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision\ndirectly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive\nevaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative\nmetrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently\nprocesses arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for\n1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade\nGPUs.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has\nlong posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.\nAlthough HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream\ntasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of\nsensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their\ntransferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a\nnovel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying\nmulti-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K\ndataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality\nbenchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS\nsensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding\nprocess for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to\ngenerate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each\nspectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own\nimage content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a\nsample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors\nfor channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction\nand latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to\nperceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and\nsensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable\nnumber of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint\npre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware\ncan learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic\nsegmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.",

However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual\ndisappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes\nhave emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a\nsingle-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its\ninfluencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods.

To address the current research limitations, this paper\nproposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates\nmulti-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial\nmorphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and\ncommunication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic\ncommunication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph\nAttention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal\nfeatures under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on\nexisting principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper\nintroduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training\nstrategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nachieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in\nmultimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint\noptimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83\n(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but\ntheir practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of\ntheir iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual\ngeneration tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our\nmodel is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse\nweather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the\nthese complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D\nperception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to\nsingle-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then\nprocessed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to\nencode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive\nexperiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection\nachieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its\neffectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.",

Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage\nprocess. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated\nusing a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison\nand quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark\nfor hallucination detection.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module\n(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract\nmulti-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit\ncorrespondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query\nobject.

Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational\ncost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive\nvisual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel\nmulti-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our\ndesign, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional\ninformation to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention\n(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce\ncomputational cost.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual\nexperiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a\npromising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current\nmethods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world\napplicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain\nvisual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific\nadaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be\ndecomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging\nadversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to\nisolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This\ndisentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any\nadditional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA\nsignificantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance\ncomparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a\nscalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model\nweights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by\ntheir sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

How do we find such\nknowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The\nmost common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define\nchallenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or\nusers actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge\nextraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,\nwhere users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs\nsteer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's\ngoals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.\nHere, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has\nlow-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps\ntherein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model\ntowards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a\ntool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer\nLLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces\nknowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even\nwith web search.

Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by\nenabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from\nvisual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to\nreach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from\npatient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create\ngold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen\nconsultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five\nopen-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and\nQwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients\nemphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care\nvalues. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional\ncontext. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L\n0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B\n(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between\nexperts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human\nPCS.",

This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource\nsettings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust\ngeneralization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by\nlearning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal\nmechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct\ncausal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we\ninvestigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically\ngenerates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious\ncorrelations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the\nNaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically\nequivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we\nexplore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the\nDINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment\nanalysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate\nthat both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data\naugmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment\nclassification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves\nout-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with\nvarying gains across languages.",

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual\nknowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge\nstorage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing\nmethods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are\noften identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other\ncomponents, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.\nThis imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing\neffectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better\ngeneralization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further\nanalysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an\noptimal range across diverse settings.",

This\nvisibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),\nbut only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).\nFully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on\nexamining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a\ncue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses\ninformation when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate\naspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more\nholistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT\nlists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and\nverbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves\nas the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes\nbased on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning\nmodels on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful\nyet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that\nmonitorability differs sharply across model families.

For token classification tasks, these strategies\nrequire label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original\nsentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to\nleverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models\nsuch as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine\ntranslation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is\nlargely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,\nyielding poor WA results.

    "abstract": "A central architectural question for both biological and artificial\nintelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,\ndomain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination\nof reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward\ngoal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for\nsystemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes\ncoherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.",

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability\nenables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM.

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has\nbrought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language\nexhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this\nquestion by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS\nadopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any\nsignificant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.\nBy applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following\ninteresting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language\ndemonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new\nperiods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text\n(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and\nfurther confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the\nperiodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured\nfactors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The\nadvantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in\nLLM-generation detection are further discussed.",

    "abstract": "Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and\ninefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none\nof the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key\ncapabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data\ncollection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that\nanswers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain\ndata. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single\npipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative\nof DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories\nof tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100\ninstances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have\ngained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of\nopen-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following\nDRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by\ncoordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs\nstructured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on\nDRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot\nachieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines\nwith up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost.

A key\naspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous\nelement of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of\nverbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception\ndetection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant\nchallenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,\nmakes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities\nin this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and\npresent a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game\nWerewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable\nground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:\neven powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood\nreliably.

The method freezes the\nbackbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to\nthe student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency\nand alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust\noptimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the\nmodel maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The\noverall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a\nregularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances\nalignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate\nits effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,\nincluding distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation\nbudgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and\ndistribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method\nsignificantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,\nand overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.\nThis work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more\ntrustworthy alignment mechanisms.",

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost.

Many regions lack\nLDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer\ndetection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening\nTrial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of\n26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)\nradiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar\nmicrostructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly\nimprove early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning\nsegmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent\nsensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially\nimproves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation\nradiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose\nalternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is\nunavailable.",

However,\nchoosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model\nperformance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot\nexamples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first\ncriterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a\nsample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about\nits usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity\nof the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples\nbased on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations\nto determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under\nvarious combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nunderstanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global\ncross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store\ntheir outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass\n(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically\nimplausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.",

Several techniques are known, with\ncompressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the\nvalue sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use\nmachine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key,\na model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we\nderive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The\nresulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This\ndesign allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier\nwhile still supporting point queries. Our experiments show substantial space\nsavings: up to one order of magnitude on real data, and up to three orders of\nmagnitude on synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both\ncompact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These\nresults highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.",

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

Among them, the\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used\nsamplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its\nempirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its\nconvergence properties -- remains limited.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler\nand establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional\nassumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition\nparameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical\ndistributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler\nwith accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of\n$$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\min\\{d,L^2\\}}{T^2}\\right)~\\text{in\nKullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the\nnumber of iterations, and $\\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.\nThis result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <\n\\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence\nanalysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions.

To systematically address diverse financial queries,\nwe propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,\ninterpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal\nreasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and\noptimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The\nframework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential\nprivacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect\nsensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements\nreal-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems\nthat verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations.

    "abstract": "Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical\ncompositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational\nmusicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive\nmodels such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt\ntheory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical\nstructure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that\noperationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and\nannotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic\nTime Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and\ninter-segment relationships.\n  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further\nlabeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor\nI-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level.\nThis labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive\ninformation, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and\nresolution.\n  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within\ncompositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between\nintra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional\nscaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects\nperceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering\ndemonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural\nfeatures that extend beyond composer identity.\n  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a\nstructured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis,\nenabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through\nthe lens of listener perception.",

However, data from different structures will follow\ndistinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for\nmodels learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,\ntransfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to\nalign the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered\n\\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do\nnot consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --\nupdating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA\nmappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this\nmodel is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to\nselect the most informative observations to label -- leading to further\nreductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The\neffectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental\nbridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several\ndamage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It\nis found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data\nefficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios.

    "abstract": "The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving\nsymmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective\npreconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

    "abstract": "The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous\nnetwork environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and\nsignificant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing\nalgorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse\nand often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However,\nexisting methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on\nimpractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To\ntackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing\nframework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on\nits own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case\nperformance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved\nby enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS\nobjectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO\nconstellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively\noptimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious\nbaseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms\nend-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by\nresolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion\navoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust\nrouting.",

    "abstract": "To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the\nleakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated\nLearning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct\neffectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve\nsignificant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation\n(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose\nunderlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the\nsemi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised\nlearning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system\nas a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation\nperformance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic\nnonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is\nused; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and\nCartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The\nperformance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\\`a-vis particle\nfilters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.",

The gap stems from two fundamental\nchallenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens\nthat is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,\nand (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens\nthat couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical\ntokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms\nto ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the\nattention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional\nencoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive\nparadigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first\nand then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for\nunconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP.

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,\nElev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are\nimportant for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,\ncanopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy\nemerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent\ntropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02\nMg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across\nall laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in\nestimating total biomass per plot.",

    "abstract": "The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication\nrounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the\neffectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several\nbaselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test\naccuracy.",

This\nvisibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),\nbut only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).\nFully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on\nexamining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a\ncue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses\ninformation when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate\naspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more\nholistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT\nlists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and\nverbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves\nas the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes\nbased on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning\nmodels on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU.

However, when a user is\nnew to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical\ndata available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To\naddress this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial\nratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early\nunderstanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally\ncategorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision\ntree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about\ntheir preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is\ngathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach\nfor rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation.

We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2.

Our results highlight the failure of batch\nmodels to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of\ncurrent datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.\nWe also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,\nwell-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,\nconfirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved\nF1-score of 0.990 $\\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch\ncounterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\\pm$ 0.007,\nreducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online\napplications despite a slight trade-off in stability.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex\nreasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,\nperforming better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

Existing model-merging techniques,\ndesigned for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to\ndeliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static\ninterpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we\nintroduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free\nframework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the\nJensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3\ndynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to\ngeneralist robustness under drift.

Recognizing the lack of a standardized\nmedical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol\nspanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.\nEmpirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error\nreduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving\nthe way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from\nbiased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We\npropose \\textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this\nbias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier\nretraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute\ncategory-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local\nfeatures to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent\npseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data\nare heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between\nthe pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,\nenhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations\nare performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments\non long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high\nrobustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.",

Achieving a robust\nand highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,\nmainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately\nannotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare\nenvironments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from\ndifferences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical\npurposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past\ndata, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our\napproach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship\nbetween previously learned knowledge and new information across different\ntraining stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.\nSpecifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our\nmethod mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual\npretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature\ndistillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge\ndistillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of\nthe model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations.

To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis\n(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned\nfunction. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying\nits: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.\nCrucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which\ntracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This\ntemporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it\nlearns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical\nlearning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before\ncomplex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,\npractical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and\npredicting the onset of overfitting.

    "abstract": "Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale\nand heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by\nconfiguration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for\nadapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing\nlatency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization\nusing machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key\nlimitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among\nparameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification\nprevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,\nlimiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,\nto reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often\nselects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that\ncontribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most\ncommon method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on\nsurrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient\nexploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel\nframework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and\nlearns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.\nRelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),\nwhich combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity\nto previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple\nDBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and\nhigher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning\nmodels toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently\ndrawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of\nfairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set\nof nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each\nprotected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that\ngroup in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to\nincorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,\nparticularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a\ncomputationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a\nnew affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that\nfairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed\non this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$\nclusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the\nsolution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic\nblock model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair\nclustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair\ngraph clustering algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting\nin low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots\nimprove convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees\nor static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit\nindividual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.\nWe address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through\nReinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for\nAI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality\nusing a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and\nSpecificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy\nthat updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with\npriors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total\nchatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation\nacross 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual\nparticipants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12\nmean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over\nnon-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in\nspecification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results\ndemonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved\nadaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving\nassessment systems.",

    "abstract": "Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from\nhistorical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline\npolicy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally\namplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might\nbenefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about\nfairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a\ngroup-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing\ngroup-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle\nthe following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained\nwithin some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized\nduring policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy\noptimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints\ninto an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the\nestimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a\ndoubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy\noptimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while\nmaintaining competitive overall performance.",

While\ntheoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training\ninstability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation.

The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

Spatial\nnormalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,\nbut often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when\nlocalization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted\nbrain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between\nindividuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)\nlearns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from\nmulti-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive\nobjectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to\nregion-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a\ntransformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of\nchannels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal\nganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording\nsessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space\nsupports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,\nregion-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The\ntransformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or\nsupervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of\nmasked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.\nTogether, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject\naggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task\nstructure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are\nmeaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and\nempirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many\napplications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and\nconsistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and\nsimilarity notions and introduce EMOC: An\nEvaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm\nimplementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile\nPACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three\nproblems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of\nalgorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity\nin LLM-generated programs.

    "abstract": "An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes\nto a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better\nviewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.",

Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on\nusers past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is\nnew to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical\ndata available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To\naddress this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial\nratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early\nunderstanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally\ncategorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision\ntree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about\ntheir preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is\ngathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach\nfor rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i)\nelicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres\nto better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at\neach node to more effectively learn user preferences.

Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM.

At their core, recommender systems\naddress a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past\ndecades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from\ncollaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to\nneural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of\ngenerative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion\nmodels, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which\nreconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative\nscoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified\ntripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than\nsimply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into\noperational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and\ntraining, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models\nenable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying\nheterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods,\nlarge recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their\nalignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new\ncapabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and\npersonalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world\nknowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities,\nscaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in\nbenchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a\nroadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape\nhuman-information interaction.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates\nefficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector\nsearch with complex relational filtering. However, existing filtered search\nsolutions are fundamentally limited by specialized indices, which restrict\narbitrary filtering and hinder integration with general-purpose DBMSs. This\nwork introduces \\textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general\nfiltered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index\ndesigns. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF\nfor vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a\nprincipled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate\ngeneration and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass\nmaintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and\nrange predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or\nmulti-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nCompass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general\nframework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query\nthroughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings\nwith only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality\nand DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution\nfor achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.",

Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are\nmostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing\nefforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to\nreplicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we\nintroduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,\nrealized in a modular soft gripper architecture.

By integrating\nrich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly\ntransition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances\ngeneralization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and\nscales (up to 10$\\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities\nsuch as multi-object and internal hook grasping.

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training\non action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on\nRoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.",

    "abstract": "Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion\nPolicy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action\n(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high\ncomputational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead\nto divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address\nthese issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium\ndynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar\nenergy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,\nEBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior\nunder distribution shifts.",

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies\nand synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations.

To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that\ncombines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The\ngripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the\ninternal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.",

To address\nthis issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile\nmanipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and\nform a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex\nmulti-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.\nThe system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision\nwith AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental\nresults show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in\ndynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently\ncooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square\n(RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes\ntasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical\nreconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative\ncontrol, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a\nkey challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for\nlarge, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor\ncoverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich\nsurroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further\ndegrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily\ndeployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;\nhowever, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting\nunderwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic\nPositioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor\nfusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the \"mother-ship\" concept,\nthe surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a\nsubmerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly\nconstrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through\nrepeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time\ntrajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance\n(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed\ninfrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages\nadvances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step\nchange in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to\nremarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most\nrecent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing\n3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for\nmany real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and\nforest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of\nWildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals\nthe unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights\npotential improvements for future works.

    "abstract": "Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon\nmethods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret\ndiffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these\nmethods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high\nscanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the\noperating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the\nperformance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns\ncaptured at short exposure times (high scan speeds).

However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

    "abstract": "Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate\nword pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's\nhigh degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches\nhave significantly advanced performance on this task.\n  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization\nthat frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach\noperates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization\npattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,\nconditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is\nits use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text\nas an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the\ninput's vector representation.\n  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we\ndemonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying\non complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting\nwhere the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided\ncandidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic\narchitectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield\nsignificant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.\nThese findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for\naccurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.",

    "abstract": "We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and\naccurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large\nlanguage models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and\ndata outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning\naffects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost\nconfidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of\ntraining, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC\nproduces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and\nunseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight\nmodels with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and\nboth model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark\nevaluations.",

    "abstract": "Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce\nlatency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical\nimplementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a\nMAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically\naddresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and\nenables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we\nmonitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two\nmajor failure modes: routing errors (5.25\\%) and query rephrasal errors\n(3.2\\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements\nthrough fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a\nfine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,\nand 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\%\ngain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,\ntransforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings\ninclude approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,\nnavigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.\nThis work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive\nenterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve\naccuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training.",

    "abstract": "Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains\nwith spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as\ninappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question\nof whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal\nmasking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because\nfew domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same\ndataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which\nnaturally supports both representations. We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models\ntrained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} -\nconsistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on\nsequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are\nmethodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to\nspatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,\nand in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.",

We show\nthat variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high\nuncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm\nrewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better\nin more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively.

This new model demonstrates a\nsignificant leap in accuracy for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling\nthe robust estimation of not only heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) but\nalso Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics. This advance is achieved through a\ncombination of a new model architecture and a substantial increase in the size\nand diversity of our training data, now totaling 1,413 unique individuals. We\nevaluate VitalLens 2.0 on a new, combined test set of 422 unique individuals\nfrom four public and private datasets. When averaging results by individual,\nVitalLens 2.0 achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.57 bpm for HR, 1.08 bpm\nfor RR, 10.18 ms for HRV-SDNN, and 16.45 ms for HRV-RMSSD. These results\nrepresent a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming previous methods.\nThis model is now available to developers via the VitalLens API at\nhttps://rouast.com/api.",

    "abstract": "Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like\nTwitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,\nautomatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a\nchallenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data\nand extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important\naspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer\ninteractions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually\nappropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame\nAggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.\nThis method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to\ngenerate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their\nsemantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient\nweighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing\nless on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention\nmechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment\nreflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the\nlimitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language\ncontent with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,\ndiverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this\ndataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million\ncomments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to\nexisting methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue\ncontexts.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply\nwith the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic\nmanipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that\npermits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate\nhow frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national\ndata protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites\nand identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the\nrelevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation\non 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic\nmanipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to\nmeasure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This\nenables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button\nplacement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common\nthan previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user\nand/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the\nEuropean Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,\nand websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU\nand from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU\nwebsites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU\nwebsites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than\nnon-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.",

    "abstract": "Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI\nremains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning\nmodels are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and\nhigh performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address\nthese gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive\nframework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is\nbuilt on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a\nSwin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention\nfusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity\nmask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction\nstrategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and\ndifficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different\nchallenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022\nChallenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a\nstate-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH\ndataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a\nstatistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it\nreached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These\nexperimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a\nrobust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

    "abstract": "Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon\nmethods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret\ndiffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation.

Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results.

However, deploying automated segmentation\nmodels in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one\ndataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain\nshift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary\nacross institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable\nquantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center\nosteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite\nelement analysis results remain reproducible across sites.

To address domain shift, we integrate two\ncomplementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment\nvia Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding\nsite-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.\nThis dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling\nscanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,\nand limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex\nknowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that\nintegrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The\nmethod builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge\nrepresentations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing\nand retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing\ncloser semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an\nuncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and\nfilter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model\nto maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false\ncontent. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,\nentropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence\ncontrol framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and\ncomparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental\nconditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the\nproposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method\nachieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval\nrecall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.\nThis study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and\ncontrollability of large models in complex contexts.",

We evaluate our approach using real-world\nconversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to\nassess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's\nresponse.

Existing approaches tend to overlook an important\naspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer\ninteractions.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame\nAggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.\nThis method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to\ngenerate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their\nsemantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient\nweighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing\nless on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention\nmechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment\nreflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the\nlimitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language\ncontent with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,\ndiverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this\ndataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million\ncomments.

Formal methods\nprovide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic\nspecifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep\nlearning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language\nconstraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with\npotentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains.

    "abstract": "We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a\nscientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such\nas generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,\nwriting and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a\nscientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle\nspecific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end\nscientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we\ndescribe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by\npresenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different\nscientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical\ninformatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,\nneuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from\ndifferent disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies\nmethods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We\nreport the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who\nprovided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the\nstrengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we\ndiscuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such\ntechnology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code\nat https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run\ndirectly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and\nthe full app will be deployed on the cloud.",

Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval.

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with\nnegligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to\nmitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair\nEncoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that\ntokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,\nsuch as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our\ntechnique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the\naverage number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is\nmotivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules\nsuch as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a\nlarge dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with\nseveral popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT\nthreshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very\nshort inputs.

By operationalizing a\nMAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically\naddresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and\nenables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we\nmonitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two\nmajor failure modes: routing errors (5.25\\%) and query rephrasal errors\n(3.2\\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements\nthrough fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a\nfine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,\nand 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\%\ngain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,\ntransforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems.

    "abstract": "Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve\naccuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have\nachieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However,\nextending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due\nto the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited\navailability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware\nmodels. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework\nfor peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3,\na multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich\npre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited\navailability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further\nintegrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of\nlearning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained\nusing distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to\nenhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that\nGeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding\nsite prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding\npatterns.",

In this work, we provide the first\nquantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization\nto occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG\nin several distinct problem settings: $\\ell_\\infty$ error control vs. average\nerror control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention\nvs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,\nand one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs\nwhen the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be\n\"simulated\" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our\nbounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for\na transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically.

In domains\nwith spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as\ninappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question\nof whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal\nmasking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because\nfew domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same\ndataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which\nnaturally supports both representations. We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models\ntrained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} -\nconsistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on\nsequential data.

Formal methods\nprovide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic\nspecifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep\nlearning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language\nconstraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with\npotentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must\naccomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to\ninformation acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in\nunstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps\n-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.\nWhile heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed\nspecifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can\naccomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,\ncurrent large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume\nwell-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured\nenvironments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations\nby grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous\nrobot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications\ndescribing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded\nsubtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to\nrobots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined\ngiven feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments\nwith closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice\nthe success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming\napproaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath\nHusky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an\n87\\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and\nrefining subtasks with online feedback.

Integrating these\nfoundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward\nbuilding general-purpose robots.

Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000\nexpert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a\nnewly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time\nWarping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties\nderived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our\nevaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial\ngrounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and\nreproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and\nleaderboard can be found at\nhttps://leggedrobotics.github.io/navitrace_webpage/.",

To address these challenges, we propose a\ndistributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be\nrepresented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one\nagent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the\nother agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to\nneighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a\nsingle agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in\nsimulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple\nsingle-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\\\"ive,\nor assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The\nalgorithm outperforms the na\\\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and\nsum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of\nmakespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it\nis asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to\neither metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots\nconfirm the feasibility of the approach.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory\nusage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.",

    "abstract": "Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in\napplications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and\nrecommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the\nconstrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for\ntextual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to\nreason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors.",

This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously\ncoordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device\ncontrol, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A\nhierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist\nagents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic\ncoordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for\ncontext-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models\nusing real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability\ndifferences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all\nscenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear\nprogramming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance\nbut struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt\nengineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without\nexplicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning\ncapabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,\nagent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,\nand future research.",

    "abstract": "Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite\nbeing an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about\nfinding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph\nthat have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

In\nthis paper, we formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Reward Density\nOptimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of\nexploration cost. This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic\nframework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem\ndecomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,\nthereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}:\ninjecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the\nprobability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:\nemploying a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep\nexploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years.

We propose\nLINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided\ncoreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of\nour approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and\nresolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated\nnarratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long\nlegal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes\nby 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent\ngraph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation\nfor analyzing complex criminal networks.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number\nof domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these\nmodels often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,\nrequire substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across\ndomains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high\ncomputational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian\nnetwork LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three\nLLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic\nmechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the\nsentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a\nBayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with\ndistinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates\nconsistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,\nunderscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of\nprobabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.",

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors.

    "abstract": "The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a\n\"Cambrian explosion\" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a\npragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood\nnot as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of\nobligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities\nfor a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society.",

    "abstract": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.\nWhile recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image\nsegmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their\neffectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples.

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for\ntasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several\nheuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior\nsampling is computationally intractable in general.\n  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave\ndistributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior\nsamples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to\nscore--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By\ncontrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an\n$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with\nan annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in\npolynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.",

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

In this work, we study the implicit bias\nof incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on\nlinearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the\nfull-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average.

    "abstract": "As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works\ntypically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to\nachieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such\nsolutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical\nrequirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,\nscalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the\nperformance of the output in a more practical setting.",

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback?

Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

Unlike methods\nbased on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified\nrewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns\ndirectly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.\n  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The\nlearned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as\n\"growth\" and \"value,\" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For\ninstance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of\nMarkowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for\nturnover, concentration, and latent factors.\n  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests\nthat explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are\ncontained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.\n  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment\nstrategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and\nregulatory oversight.",

However,\nacquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and\ntime-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view\nsupervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by\nemploying cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes\nmultiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the\nmodel exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised\nor VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need\nfor actual radiology reports.",

Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

This amounts to\naveraging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate\nsettings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human\ndevelopment and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair?

    "abstract": "Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface\n(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap\nstems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as\nsupervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.\nBy analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI\nknowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about\nrecognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge\nabout reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,\nknowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We\nfurther introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and\nyes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,\nIOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify\nwidget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting\nactions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks\nfurther validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By\nproviding a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports\nthe selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and\nprovides insights for building more capable GUI agents.",

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Our method outperforms existing\nintervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for\nVLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through\nactivation engineering.",

To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image\nREconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies\nwith 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust\ntraining of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)\nfacilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.\nWe further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior\napproaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:\n(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of\nmodels, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen\nanatomies.

In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,\nclimate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing\nmotion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,\noffering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

    "abstract": "Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite\nbeing an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about\nfinding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph\nthat have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

The UAV dataset, acquired over\nVicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks.

The\nestimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,\nreflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate\nMask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas\nYOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net\nremains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option.

    "abstract": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),\nplays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical\napplications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose\nthe Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and\nfine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with\nautomatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking\nthrough 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are\ncompetitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current\npoint tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose\nto combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence\nalong with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a\nrelatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and\nevaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively\nremoving any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point\ncorrespondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on\nfour datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\\%\nocclusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\\% for CoTracker2; and\nsignificantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs\n82.8).

    "abstract": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to\nachieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM\ncalibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly\navailable.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods.

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,\nprevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing\nto produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative\napproaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints\ndirectly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization\nstage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a\nnovel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,\nCATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates\nmode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning\nsignals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit\nconstraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the\ngenerated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,\nCATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during\ngeneration, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the\nNavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and\nwas honored with the Innovation Award.",

    "abstract": "Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of\nbalancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

To address\nthis gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse\ndocument layouts, covering six common document types and comprising\ncontemporary layouts collected from multiple sources.

The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for\nsustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4\nproduct relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%\nis attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an\naverage improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer\nanimation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and\nsubjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses\nprevious ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

We design three tasks:\nsingle-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn\nconversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for\nboth image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval.

However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The\nresults show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw\ndetection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values\nabove 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse\ntraffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.",

    "abstract": "Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided\nDiagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,\nacquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and\ntime-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view\nsupervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by\nemploying cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes\nmultiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a\nnovel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and\naccuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast\ntissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these\npatterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated\nour method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that\nthe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three\nclassification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype\nclassification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the\nmodel exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised\nor VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need\nfor actual radiology reports.",

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution\nof video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several\nchallenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR\nfor AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency\npriors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation\nunit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a\nsecond-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of\nadjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and\ncontent-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods\nin terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference\nspeed.

    "abstract": "Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.\nPrevious part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens\noften suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

    "abstract": "Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric\npopulations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert\nannotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and\ntransferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and\nmore confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their\ngeneral knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.\nTherefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a\ncrucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an\nexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited\nfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

Specifically, Evontree extracts\ndomain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core\nontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both\nunmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%\nimprovement in accuracy.

    "abstract": "Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic\nmodality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and\nconsensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were\ntested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\n  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The\nhighest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).\nThe average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).\nLlama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater\nprecision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between\nTop-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\n  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a\nmore consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective\nevaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables\ndevelopers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.\nTo streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review\napproaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly\nadvanced the capabilities of automated review generation.

To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new\napproach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve\nsecurity-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a\ndataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.\nLeveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments\nthat can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with\nour proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the\noverall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.",

    "abstract": "Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge\nin software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can\naccurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended\nfor a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The\nimproved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug\ndetection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases\nfrom 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of\nautomated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

However, most existing\nLLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely\nneglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for\nreal-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsurpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the\nbest-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.\nThese results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the\nchallenges of applying LLMs in education.",

We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64.

    "abstract": "Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to\nidentify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats\nemerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

While\nKnowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring\nknowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an\nunderexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD\nbehavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on\ncross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability\nunder model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP\nand SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual\nQA.

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language\nmodels (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose\nReasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits\nreasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and\nrefines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a\nbrief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop\nreasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and\nconsolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,\nrequiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.\nEvaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning\ncurriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis\nindicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation\nincreases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning\nCurriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.",

Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we\ntook the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point\nand developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with\none of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10\ndifferent prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using\ndifferent majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of\ninstances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The\nsilver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on\nthe majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver\ndatasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,\nCause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive\ntexts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,\nRepetition and to cast Doubt.

    "abstract": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning\nability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often\nbecomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one\nsolution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer\nand can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we\npropose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that\nexposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus\nincreases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring\nsemantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce\nReasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores\nLong Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate\nreasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and\nfine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields\nmore varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16\nover a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that\n1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

Our benchmark offers\ntwo key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator\nenvironment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of\ndomain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error\nclassification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it\nincorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming\ncontests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of\nLLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even\nadvanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting\nthe difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3\nreach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written\ncodes (39.98%).

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers.

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density\nRatio Estimation and Riesz Regression.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a\ntreatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally\nefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step\ntypically required in EWM.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful\nstrategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.\nHowever, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require\nquerying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes\nprohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or\nresource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary\nexpert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral\nframework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing\nexpert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both\ntwo-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively\nquery only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active\nlearning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and\nthe core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost\nand predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our\nalgorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.\nEmpirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially\nreduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating\nthe practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead\nto known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are\nattractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and\ninterpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural\nnetworks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator\nhave been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To\naddress this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network\ntraining that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical\nBayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior\nmean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its\ninverse reconstruction map.

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and\nhandcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce\n\\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework\nfor automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks\n(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits\nsequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward\nfunction that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,\nand gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits\ndesigned by \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding\ncircuits that are 10$\\times$-30$\\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,\ngates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without\ncompromising accuracy.

However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs.

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level\nobservations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with\nimportant implications for the downstream performance of many applications.\nDespite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed\nin the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that\nno overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very\nheterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

However,\nBO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.\nRecent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the\nrelationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we\ndevelop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a\nsystematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this\nframework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either\nrelated or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in\nour experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results\npresented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially\nwhen the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In\ncontrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima.

Existing datasets in this domain are\ntypically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

Our framework supports both standalone\nimplementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to\naccelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model\nfamilies demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from\n$3.31\\times$ to $4.01\\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \\times$ for\nLLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \\times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \\times$ for\nQwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and\nbackground expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize\ncounterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse\nalternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or\ntext-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating\nintervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving\nbeneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.\nWithout retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both\nworst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing\na new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a\nlightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical\ncausal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.",

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model\ntraining across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling\nprivacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.\nHowever, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally\ndifferent neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain\nscarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and\nhippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior\nperformance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight.

To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

These\nfindings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous\noutputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain\nthis conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify\nthe lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite\nsurfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable\nrepresentations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal\nacross their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to\ncreate universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the\ncauses of output errors -- to specific layers.

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

STAR\nincorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural\nnetwork, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models\nwhile maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage\npre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth\nlow-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to\ndenoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user\npreference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite\nthe progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or\nitems to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in\nreal-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and\nmodel-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying\nmulti-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows\nthat naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several\ndomain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained\nsolely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first\nexperimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based\ncross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and\ntarget domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.\nWeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not\nintroduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the\nupper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments\non single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation\nscenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation\nand consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation\ntasks.",

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision\nmaking, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query\ncase. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and\npretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are\nrich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the\ncrucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can\nlead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the\ndistinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,\nmirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such\ninformation into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy\nof case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to\nleverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal\nreasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context\nlegal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language\nmodel. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and\nCOLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings\nsubstantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting\nthe potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.\nThe code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.",

However, these efforts typically proceed on separate\ntracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also\nprevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental\nresults on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales\nefficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.",

However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and\nare confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools\nefficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the\ndesired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool\norientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering\nframework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse\nkinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions\nusing tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action\ntrajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired\nskills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive\nexperimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver\ndemonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our\ntrained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our\nmodel achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two\ndistinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of\npotential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool\nusage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across\ndiverse tasks.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and\nembodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,\nscalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N).

    "abstract": "The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,\nmaterial properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies\ncan be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate\nintelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,\nwe discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a\nparticular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent\ndevelopment of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the\ncontrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that\ndecouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a\ncollection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous\nMicrorobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent\nbehavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical\ninteraction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such\nas the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot\nexemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart\nactuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the\nrobotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only\na method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of\nEI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for\nrobotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.",

Visualization techniques, such as class\nactivation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify\nregions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.\nFurthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more\ngeneralizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.\nHowever, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated\ndirectly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains\nlimited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations\nenriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In\nthis work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D\nindoor SLAM.

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against\nopponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world.

Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes.

    "abstract": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

Together, these techniques\nsubstantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search.\nExperimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed\nby 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query\nand incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the\ntraditional coupled architecture.",

The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N.

Two complementary strategies were explored:\n(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)\nfoundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants\nthrough prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the\nSAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1\nb+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on\nthe small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize\noverfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,\nand a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was\napplied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve\ngeneralization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300\nepochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently\napplied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time\naugmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible\nperformance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the\nhidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall\nin the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings\nprovides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress\nenabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the\nactual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve\nresults comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

    "abstract": "Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due\nto their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

    "abstract": "Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,\nand animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories.

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o\nconfirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.",

We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and\nState-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.\nSurprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models\nconsistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across\nmultiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we\nintroduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating\nthe Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.\nResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a\nDice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise\nboundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The\nmodel's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of\n0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately\nidentifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance\ninterpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the\nregion's most influential predictions, providing insights into its\ndecision-making process.

Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained.

To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space.

In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly\nreduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various\nsystem and data dynamics.",

In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied.

In this work, we\npropose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a\ntool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.\nSpecifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given\nquery, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a\ntree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step\nacross different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps\nunder the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards\nare used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with\ntrajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use.

To address\nthis gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that\nreformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\".

As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR.

Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale.

A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant\nvariant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to\n14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality\nfake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest\nperformance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve\nas a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of\nmisinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens\nthe door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the\nwild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection\ntechniques.",

This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an\nextensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic\nannotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology\nemployed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental\nsettings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation.

However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when\nhuman judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking\ntraces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging\nto collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer\nthinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a\nsimple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at\nscale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:\n(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation\nguidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods\nlead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined\nannotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These\nresults suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise\nunrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended\ninto thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM\nraters.",

Although diagrams\nare presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce\nclear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction\nis to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which\ncan leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs).

In this paper, we propose\nDiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration\ndiagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams\nas graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed\nedges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node\nalignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate\ndiagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,\nquantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show\nhow the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable\ninsights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete.

Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

While LLMs are\nable to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance\nrankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail\nto align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the\nlimitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk\nprediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated\nexplanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,\nbaseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight\nwhen deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.",

We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data\ninto understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.\nWe first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for\nunderstanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,\nforming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation\nsample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a\nretrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired\nstructures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent\npolicy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware\nvariant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity\nscore to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from\nwell-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality\ndataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on\nthe powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on\nvarious UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a\ngateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates\nwith differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization\nwithout weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are\npart of each public statement.

Despite\nrecent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their\nability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of\nEHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially\nrespond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.\nOne under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,\nencompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely\nrely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to\nfailure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic\nfeatures influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through\nopen-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether\nmodel behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce\na new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,\ndesigned to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work\nprovides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular\nnon-lexical aspects of speech perception.",

    "abstract": "We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)\narchitecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized\nquantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden\nstate is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially\nlarge Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control\nfor input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with\nup to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,\nand language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to\nobtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum\nmemory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit\nreadouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine\ntranslation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)\ngrounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against\nstrong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them\nto be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes\ndomains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically\noptimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,\ncreating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs\ninto a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,\nour model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,\nproving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,\nreal-world impact.

However, most automatic methods generate each\nAD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD\nsequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches\nthat rely on independent generations.",

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the\nconsistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:\nparaphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence\nlength. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This\nmotivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond\ntext-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.",

    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).\nHowever, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,\ndynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural\nLanguage Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains\nlike religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination\nand unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly\ncritical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and\ntrustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for\nPersian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is\ncrucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.",

    "abstract": "Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It\ntypically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the\nquery and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and\nrelevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers\ndemonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing\nit as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.",

We propose\nTime-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a\nmodel inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters\ncapture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing\nboth fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec\nachieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction\npatterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for\nself-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.",

    "abstract": "In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in\nmodeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

This paper introduces\nStuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that\nenables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or\npassenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the\nBench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios.

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has\nbeen proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled\nas rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

    "abstract": "Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications\nsuch as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive\ndevices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the\naccuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling\ndependable performance across real-world applications.",

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --\nspecifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To\nthis end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the\nenvironment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance\nfields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to\ngenerate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.\nWe then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to\nsynthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of\ncaution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The\nsafety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety\nconstraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a\nsemantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

    "abstract": "Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a\nlong-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling\nbetween body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design.",

State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods\nfocused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a\ntask to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these\nmethods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with\nthe correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,\ngrasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,\nespecially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool.

    "abstract": "The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the\npromise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with\ntransferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a\nfoundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates\nsocial awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve\nprescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is\nassigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or\nself-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system.\nBuilding on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT\nframework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its\nsocial interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law\nis derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby\navoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a\nsocially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The\nproposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is\ncomputationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances.\nThe effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through\nsimulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional",

    "abstract": "In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an\nabstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics\nproblems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the\ndownward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain.",

Previous\nstudies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying\nprinciples with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether\nwhip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features\nobserved in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.\nPlatform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while\nsystematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of\npropagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding\nmedium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new\nperspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential\nplatform for future hydrodynamic research.",

    "abstract": "Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by\nencoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:\nconventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire\ndepth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an\nill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

However, designing appropriate gaits\nfor each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller\nswitching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research\ndevelops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and\nterrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the\nimplicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's\nbody structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible\njoints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg\nstructure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper\nevaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three\ndeveloped leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy\nconsumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the\nexistence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic\nand terrestrial environments under identical control.",

    "abstract": "Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic\nthat benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp\napplication that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning\nusing the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets\nwill be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),\nhave been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent\nchallenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full\nocclusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%\nocclusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the\nrobustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot\nvision applications.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for\ncomplex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.",

However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

We curated 81k\nopen-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing\nsynthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes,\nstructured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The\nextraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis\nprocedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable\nLLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source\nsoftware library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora\nand synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible\ninfrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable\ninformation.

However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that\nMiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality\njudgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation.

Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,\nR3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within\nthe RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the\nenvironment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the\nretriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original\nretriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving\ncomparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on\npost-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,\nrequiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

We present PerFine, a\nunified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization\nthrough iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM\ngenerator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic\nLLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on\ntone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then\nrevises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across\niterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,\nGoodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization\nover PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5\nrefinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These\nresults highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful\nparadigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and\nmodel-agnostic.",

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm\nreplaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by\nautoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,\nthese techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and\ncandidate diversity.",

This paper\npresents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a\nnovel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata.

Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval\noptimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.\nAdditionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,\ncost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical\ntrade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency.

    "abstract": "The pre-ranking stage plays a pivotal role in large-scale recommender systems\nbut faces an intrinsic trade-off between model expressiveness and computational\nefficiency. Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,\nDUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the\nmain traffic for hundreds of millions of users.",

The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,\ncameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source\nDVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects\nof UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the\ndesign of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to\nother multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world\ntests validate our approach.",

By leveraging the stereo camera's direct\ndepth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU\ninitialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.\nWith precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the\npose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) problem for pose tracking.

    "abstract": "The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot\nscheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial\nlogistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist\nfor planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate\ntoward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the\nrobots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic\nPrize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the\npresence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy\nconstraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and\nstar graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs\nthat coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a\nrank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal\nRank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in\ntemporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious\nOrdinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's\nsenior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and\nsynthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show\nthat 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies\nthat scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the\nglobal index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced\nprize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.\nFinally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%\noptimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer\nlinear programming.",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions.

This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios.",

While recent\napproaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised\nrepresentation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms\nsuch as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or\nscene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize\n2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and\ndynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present\nDynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and\ndynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future\nprediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on\nmulti-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future\ndynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned\nrepresentations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic\nmanipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two\nchallenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic\nexperiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,\ngeneralization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability\nacross diverse manipulation tasks.",

We apply a structured evaluation\nframework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,\nClaude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions\ngenerated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze\nand Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate\nsome ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of\nthe environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition\ngranularity and task complexity.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and\nautonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive\nway. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these\nsystems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of\nhumans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style\nmanipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.\nThe approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of\ntool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The\ndiscriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation\ndata executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates\nrealistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human\nmotion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and\nthe results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation\nskills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot\narm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards\ndeveloping robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a\nmore natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in\na manner similar to how humans do.",

Recently, it has gained\nprominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where\nachieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of\ntasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates\na (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the\ntask's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is\ncompelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that\ncloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its\nfully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg\ninsertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from\nthe Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical\nanalysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with\n$\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to\nthe demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and\npractice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with\nfewer demonstrated tasks.

However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital\nand physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four\nmodel families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving\n$\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a\nsignificant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era\nof Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human\nwelfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of\nrobots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex\ntask planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up\nnew pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents\noften lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control\ntasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic\nmanipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical\nworld. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises\na human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an\naction execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a\nvision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task\nperformance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent\nachieves a 28\\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real\nenvironments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly\nimproving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction\ntasks.",

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation\nLearning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and\ncovariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is\ntypically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and\nmaps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We\nintroduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory\nScoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs\nwithout losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of\nour knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only\nlearning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.\nZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable\nactions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three\nbenchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop\nplanning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM\n(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on\nHUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.",

    "abstract": "The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new\npossibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Financial documents are essential sources of information for regulators,\nauditors, and financial institutions, particularly for assessing the wealth and\ncompliance of Small and Medium-sized Businesses. However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes.

This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents\nand hinders the scalability of the visual search system.

Empirically,\n$\\textrm{E}^2\\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR\nreranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also\nshow that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the\nMTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can\neffectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational\nefficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively\nadapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which\nthey produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the\nstructure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action\nSimulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a\nmodel of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in\ncognitive space. Our agent starts by building a \"cognitive map\" by performing a\nlightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner\nproposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in\ncognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and\nupdate the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On\nthe WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%\nsuccess rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous\nsystems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.\nAblations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and\nlook-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the\ndesign of our system",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising\nmethod to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external\nknowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval\nstrategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of\nretrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when\nto retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved\ninformation effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a\nquery-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality\nselection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response\nquality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction\nTuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize\nretrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we\nadopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert\nquestion-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation\nquality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.",

    "abstract": "Users tend to remember failures of a search session more than its many\nsuccesses. This observation has led to work on search robustness, where systems\nare penalized if they perform very poorly on some queries. However, this\nprinciple of robustness has been overlooked within a single query. An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods. VRisker reduces worst-case intent failures by up to 33% with a minimal\n2% drop in average performance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities\nin tool use, yet progress in tool retrieval remains hindered by incomplete and\nheterogeneous tool documentation. To address this challenge, we introduce\nTool-DE, a new benchmark and framework that systematically enriches tool\ndocumentation with structured fields to enable more effective tool retrieval,\ntogether with two dedicated models, Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank. We design a\nscalable document expansion pipeline that leverages both open- and\nclosed-source LLMs to generate, validate, and refine enriched tool profiles at\nlow cost, producing large-scale corpora with 50k instances for embedding-based\nretrievers and 200k for rerankers. On top of this data, we develop two models\nspecifically tailored for tool retrieval: Tool-Embed, a dense retriever, and\nTool-Rank, an LLM-based reranker. Extensive experiments on ToolRet and Tool-DE\ndemonstrate that document expansion substantially improves retrieval\nperformance, with Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank achieving new state-of-the-art\nresults on both benchmarks. We further analyze the contribution of individual\nfields to retrieval effectiveness, as well as the broader impact of document\nexpansion on both training and evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight both\nthe promise and limitations of LLM-driven document expansion, positioning\nTool-DE, along with the proposed Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank, as a foundation for\nfuture research in tool retrieval.",

However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)\nconstruction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of\nreal-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent\nzero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance\non prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as\nwell as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that\nbuilds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from\nunstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained\n\"atomic\" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it\nconstructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling\nthat distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The\nresulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%\nbetter stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,\ndemonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.",

To\nbetter capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring\nfunction that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses\nGaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of\ncandidate passages.
