    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in\ndomains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface\nmanipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.",

    "abstract": "Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding\ngreat promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they\ncould also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the\nrisk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous\ndata during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach\nremains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune\nthese models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \\eval, a\nframework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce\nthe dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \\eval assesses models'\nvirus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,\nmutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that\ncurrent filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded\nknowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits\nbroader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals\nmay already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via\nsimple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data\nfiltering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research\ninto robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation\nmodels.",

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height:\nElev\\.minimum, Elev\\.L3, lev\\.MAD.mode, Elev\\.mode, Elev\\.MAD\\.median, and\nElev\\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while\nLeaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and\nfull-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values\nestimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste\nprovince ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha.

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive\nmultimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D\nimaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and\ncomputed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,\nsmall and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired\nwith 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid\nrule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,\nwe propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,\nCT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges\nglobal contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing\nclinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human\nevaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report\ngeneration quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nunderstanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global\ncross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store\ntheir outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass\n(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically\nimplausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image\nanalysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated\ndatasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging\nmodalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that\npre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome\ndata scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.",

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.",

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement\nlearning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,\nspecialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale.

These tasks\nprovide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or\nLVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning\nwhile preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding\nbenchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average\naccuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines.

    "abstract": "The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow\nbenchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.\nTherefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a\ndiagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional\ngeneralization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

However, these approaches often suffer from high\ncomputational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead\nto divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address\nthese issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium\ndynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar\nenergy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,\nEBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior\nunder distribution shifts.",

However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers\neither rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems\nsuch as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture\nthe decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some\ninadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be\nformally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee\nverifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic\ndecision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for\nfunctions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of\nLLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or\nreal-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)\ntests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill\ncause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score\n65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art\nLLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity\nincreases.

    "abstract": "Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose\nbackbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as\nelectroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification\nfoundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification\nand sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on\nheterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining\non purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,\nconsistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and\nCBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest\nthat generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of\nnon-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG.

    "abstract": "To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the\nleakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated\nLearning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct\neffectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve\nsignificant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm\nacross modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule\ngeneration remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental\nchallenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens\nthat is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,\nand (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens\nthat couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical\ntokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms\nto ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the\nattention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional\nencoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive\nparadigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first\nand then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for\nunconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,\nit significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for\ntargeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all\n5 metrics.",

    "abstract": "AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training\nlarge-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of\nfederated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning\nsettings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW\noften yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)\nthe local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing\nmoment estimates ($\\boldsymbol{v}$, $\\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down\nconvergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first\n\\underline{Fed}erated \\underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \\texttt{FedAdamW},\nfor training and fine-tuning various large models. \\texttt{FedAdamW} aligns\nlocal updates with the global update using both a \\textbf{local correction\nmechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.\n\\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \\texttt{mean} of the second-moment\nestimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them.

We also employ PAC-Bayesian\ngeneralization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay\nin local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of\n\\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models.

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently\noutperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and\nout-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on\nmathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,\n32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct.

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the\ncontent matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video\npair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic\nvariation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic\ncollapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but\nsuffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and\n``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised\nfine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can\nimprove efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper\nintroduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously\nenhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing\napproach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer\nresponses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult\nproblems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that\ndynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on\nthe model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient\nreasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory\nthought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the\nmodel to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing\nreasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds\nchallenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show\nthat DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior\naccuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.",

We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a\nframework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning\nunknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable\nlatent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational\nalignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in\npreviously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)\nsteering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational\nalignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation\nwithout the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the\ncost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one\nhigh-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and\ncontrollable at minimal marginal cost.",

This challenge often traps users in\ninefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise\nlevels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to\na Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for\ninformation to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed\nagent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core\nmechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of\ninformation theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from\ndialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to\nthe reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward\ndesign enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or\nexternal reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated\nsimulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the\nchallenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,\nincluding ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across\nuser expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nNous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to\nvarying user expertise.

    "abstract": "The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication\nrounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the\neffectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several\nbaselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test\naccuracy.",

However, most existing\nmethods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are\noften identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other\ncomponents, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.\nThis imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing\neffectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better\ngeneralization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods.

    "abstract": "Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human\nroad user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing\napproaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or\n'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack\nflexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor\nconstraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in\ninteractive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions.",

Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals,\nSNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more\nenergy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive\nanalysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional\nperformance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike\ncount, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient\ndescent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP),\nare examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs\nclosely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the\n20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve\ncompetitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation\nwindows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike\ncounts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making\nthem optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the\nsuitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive\napplications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While\npromising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for\nunderstanding and improving business processes. In many real-world\napplications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable\nprocess executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant\nbehavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,\ndelays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide\nprocess discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process\nmodel without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for\nconformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical\nbehavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may\nobscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By\nlearning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we\ngroup traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery\nseparately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models\nthat reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The\napproach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on\nmultiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and\nvisualizing critical process patterns.",

This is particularly advantageous for complex\nnon-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more\nefficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for\nlong-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.\nIn such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with\nthe number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by\nintroducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to\nexpress complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are\nassociated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)\nCoupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages\ncoupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM\nscales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems\nwith unordered subtasks.",

In this paper, we\nask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual\nscene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding\nmethods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance\nof human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new\napproach for ultra-low bitrate image description.

To address this important issue, we propose to\nseamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint\ntext and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise\ngeneration of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent\nare both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image\nreconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while\nusing much less bandwidth.

While angiographic image\nanalysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying\ncardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality\ncan significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery\nSegmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline\ncomprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel\nmultichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham\nmethod provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by\n0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using\nthe techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network\nbuilt on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational\nNeural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of\nnarrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further\nsuppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a\ncombination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic\narteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an\nIoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a\nrobust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable\ntool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.",

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability\nenables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex\nreasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,\nperforming better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

Most existing dataset\ndistillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the\nprocess. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and\nredundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset\nwithout considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,\nwe present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that\nleverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the\ndistillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on\nits estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial\ndata while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular\ndesign, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation\nframeworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve\nthe quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy\ngains of up to 7.8%.",

Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM.

To address the current research limitations, this paper\nproposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates\nmulti-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial\nmorphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and\ncommunication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic\ncommunication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph\nAttention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal\nfeatures under a two-stage feature update mechanism.

Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nachieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in\nmultimodal fusion and classification tasks.

This collective contribution classifies\nthe state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS\nlifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic\nbackbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and\nconfiguration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and\ndigital twin as continuous feedback.

A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to\nnetwork- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling\nacross variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,\ntraining, compliance).

    "abstract": "Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous\nrobots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies\nand synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental\nresults indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing\nnear-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online\nsolver.",

To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage.

Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods.

The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison\nand quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark\nfor hallucination detection.

This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and\nflatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We\nalso provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex\nand non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their\neffectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,\nlarge-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing\nresults show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy\n(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of\n2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially\nopens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.",

However, current\nmethods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world\napplicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain\nvisual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific\nadaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be\ndecomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging\nadversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to\nisolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This\ndisentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any\nadditional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA\nsignificantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance\ncomparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a\nscalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model\nweights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.",

Although AI survey chatbots\nimprove convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees\nor static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit\nindividual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.\nWe address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through\nReinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for\nAI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality\nusing a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and\nSpecificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy\nthat updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with\npriors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total\nchatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation\nacross 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual\nparticipants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12\nmean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over\nnon-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in\nspecification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior.

Although level generators and the\nproperties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability)\ndominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that\nemotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative\nand multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and\nmultimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose.\nHowever, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what\ndegree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output\nfor a generative system to target.\n  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a\nquantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level\ngenerators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis\ntractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed\nprompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several\nstandardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification\n(ESC-50) dataset. The resulting audio is analyzed along key acoustic dimensions\n(e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre).

    "abstract": "Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and\nentanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,\nmost existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or\nunitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While\ntheoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training\ninstability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By\njointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates\ncontrollable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative\ndynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties\nserve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better\nviewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.",

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities. We will release our code and models.",

    "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer\nscreening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack\nLDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer\ndetection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening\nTrial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of\n26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)\nradiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar\nmicrostructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly\nimprove early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning\nsegmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent\nsensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially\nimproves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation\nradiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose\nalternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is\nunavailable.",

    "abstract": "In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly\nenhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability\nof GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the\nWasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the\nperception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully\ndistilled into the sender.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image\nanalysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated\ndatasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging\nmodalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that\npre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome\ndata scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by\nenabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from\nvisual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their\ncore, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by\nstep until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This\nprocess gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.\nThe very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,\nimperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.\nSuch tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this\nvulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while\nleaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong\npredictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive\nHard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the\npower of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to\nenable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings\nfor the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster\ntogether in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same\nclass while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps\nthe model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient\ncues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and\nrobust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard\nadversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial\nguidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more\nstructured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and\nrobustness.",

Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

    "abstract": "The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow\nbenchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.\nTherefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a\ndiagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional\ngeneralization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

However, automated analysis of\nhistorical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide\nstylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing\nlinked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information\nfrom multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating\nbuildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying\nenvironmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for\nautomatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a\nvisual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with\nfew-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images\nand time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,\nenabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from\nsimilar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal\nfeatures. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time\nSeries Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time\nseries from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.\nExperimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively\nand can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited\nsupervision or using pseudo videos.

    "abstract": "The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid\ngrowth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This\ndemonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and\nmaintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.",

However, current generative models have two major\nlimitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking\nsemantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange\nindependent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation\nmethods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users\ninto the cumbersome cycle of \"writing-compiling-reviewing\" and lack the\nintuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet\nthe needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in\nscientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent\nframework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.\nVisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a\nToolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector\ngraphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be\nexplicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and\nany element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the\nquality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with\nseven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density\nscientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,\nand interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments\nto verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our\nevaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,\npresenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of\ntheir respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the\nimpacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of\nillustrations.",

    "abstract": "Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where\nboth the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional\nmethods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches\ntypically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting\ntheir adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,\na zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that\nrequires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an\niterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and\nprogressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized\nneural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the\nblur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data\nconsistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation\nis our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and\nprovides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow\nDeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input\nimage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in\nhighly degraded scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the\ncontent matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video\npair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic\nvariation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic\ncollapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion\nmodels has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal\nconcerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing\ndeepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from\npoor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,\nwhich is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This\nstudy proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise\nresiduals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep\nlearning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\ntransformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF\nv2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines\nand demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nhybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.\nRobustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87\nat QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations\n(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and\nforensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82\npercent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm\nthat hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability\nof deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient\nand trustworthy deepfake detection systems.",

Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new\napproach for ultra-low bitrate image description.

The semantic text description and coding latent\nare both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image\nreconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while\nusing much less bandwidth.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into\npretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the\napplication of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains\nunderexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class\nsets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook\nthe inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring\nscenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task\nimages, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that\nprompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across\ntasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated\nby this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection\n(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD\nemploys networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate\nknowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD\nfurther engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments\non PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's\neffectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among\nexisting baselines.",

While angiographic image\nanalysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying\ncardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality\ncan significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery\nSegmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline\ncomprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel\nmultichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham\nmethod provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by\n0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using\nthe techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network\nbuilt on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational\nNeural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of\nnarrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further\nsuppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a\ncombination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic\narteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an\nIoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%.

    "abstract": "Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in\ndiffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a\nnovel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial\ntraining to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood\nof sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of\nadversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this\nwork, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of\nconcept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept\nspace? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual\nsemantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting\nof concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there\nare few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object\nconcept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.\nMotivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE\n(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging\nsemantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and\nperform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art\nmethods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM\nunlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure\nperformance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training\ntime by 90%.

Despite their notable achievements, it has become\nevident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,\nrestricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we\npresent two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the\ndenoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel\ndenoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches\nto defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that\nhigh-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted\ncompared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising\nnetwork that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a\ntransformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,\nwhich enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.\nExperimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets\nreveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,\nsubstantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and\nadversarial training approaches.

    "abstract": "Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential\ntechnique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological\nfoundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving\nmeaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.\nHowever, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity\ncaused by diverse private training datasets and different network\narchitectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we\nutilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To\nfully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we\npropose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,\ncalled FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The\nmain contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To\nguarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a\nmulti-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via\nmultiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\npatch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online\ncapture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\nslide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the\nconnections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung\ncancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an\nintractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a\nself-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a\nlearning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is\nguided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.\nGiven an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid\nmesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict\nthe motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted\nresult is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in\nthe input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate\ngeometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function\nincorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic\nobjects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain\nsimple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce\na clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates\nthe need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision\ndirectly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive\nevaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative\nmetrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently\nprocesses arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for\n1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade\nGPUs.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has\nlong posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.\nAlthough HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream\ntasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of\nsensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their\ntransferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a\nnovel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying\nmulti-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K\ndataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality\nbenchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS\nsensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding\nprocess for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to\ngenerate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each\nspectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own\nimage content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a\nsample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors\nfor channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction\nand latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to\nperceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and\nsensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable\nnumber of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint\npre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware\ncan learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic\nsegmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.",

Existing studies primarily adopt a\nsingle-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its\ninfluencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These\nefforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and\ninsufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper\nproposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates\nmulti-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial\nmorphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and\ncommunication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic\ncommunication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph\nAttention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal\nfeatures under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on\nexisting principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper\nintroduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training\nstrategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nachieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in\nmultimodal fusion and classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from\npre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original\ntraining data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.\nHowever, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire\nimage area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution\nimages from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two\nunderlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy\nbackgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon\nwe term \"hallucination\" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension\nto speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their\noriginal loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic\nforegrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential\nspurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we\nvalidate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion\nacceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced\ndownstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge\ntransfer.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but\ntheir practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of\ntheir iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual\ngeneration tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our\nmodel is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse\nweather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the\nthese complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D\nperception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to\nsingle-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then\nprocessed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to\nencode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive\nexperiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection\nachieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its\neffectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.",

Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage\nprocess. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated\nusing a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison\nand quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark\nfor hallucination detection.

Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of\nquery objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain\nspatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object\nlocations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer\ninformation between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship\nfeature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge\nnoise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module\n(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract\nmulti-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit\ncorrespondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query\nobject. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object\ngeo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the \"Ground-to-Drone\"\nlocalization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in\n\"Ground-to-Drone\" localization task.

Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational\ncost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive\nvisual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel\nmulti-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our\ndesign, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional\ninformation to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention\n(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce\ncomputational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient\nlightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT\nserves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes\nto democratization of generative AI models.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to\nremarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most\nrecent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing\n3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for\nmany real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and\nforest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of\nWildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals\nthe unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights\npotential improvements for future works.

However, current\nmethods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world\napplicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain\nvisual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific\nadaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be\ndecomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging\nadversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to\nisolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This\ndisentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any\nadditional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA\nsignificantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance\ncomparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a\nscalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model\nweights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.",

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost.

How do we find such\nknowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The\nmost common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define\nchallenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or\nusers actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge\nextraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,\nwhere users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs\nsteer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's\ngoals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.\nHere, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has\nlow-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps\ntherein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model\ntowards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a\ntool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer\nLLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces\nknowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even\nwith web search.

SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by\nenabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from\nvisual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Then, these models\nwere fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch\nclinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical\nnotes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task\nperformance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and\ngeneral biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical\ndomain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted\nmodel. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.\nMoreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons\ncontributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.\nWithin the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide\nmeaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate\nthe lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to\nreach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from\npatient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create\ngold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen\nconsultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five\nopen-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and\nQwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients\nemphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care\nvalues. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional\ncontext. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L\n0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B\n(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between\nexperts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human\nPCS.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow\nthe same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios\ndue to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource\nsettings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust\ngeneralization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by\nlearning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal\nmechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct\ncausal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we\ninvestigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically\ngenerates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious\ncorrelations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the\nNaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically\nequivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we\nexplore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the\nDINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment\nanalysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate\nthat both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data\naugmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment\nclassification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves\nout-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with\nvarying gains across languages.",

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

    "abstract": "Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable\nlanguage models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and\ndifficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training\nof model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE\ncomponents, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a\nframework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning\nunknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable\nlatent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational\nalignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in\npreviously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)\nsteering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational\nalignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation\nwithout the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the\ncost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one\nhigh-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and\ncontrollable at minimal marginal cost.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual\nknowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge\nstorage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing\nmethods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are\noften identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other\ncomponents, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.\nThis imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing\neffectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better\ngeneralization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further\nanalysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an\noptimal range across diverse settings.",

This\nvisibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),\nbut only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).\nFully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on\nexamining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a\ncue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses\ninformation when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate\naspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more\nholistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT\nlists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and\nverbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves\nas the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes\nbased on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning\nmodels on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU.

    "abstract": "In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP\ntasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on\nnoisy source language data translated from the target language -- and\ntranslate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the\nsource language -- have been established as competitive approaches for\ncross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies\nrequire label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original\nsentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to\nleverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models\nsuch as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine\ntranslation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is\nlargely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,\nyielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a\nnovel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT\nmodel.

    "abstract": "A central architectural question for both biological and artificial\nintelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,\ndomain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination\nof reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward\ngoal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for\nsystemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes\ncoherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.",

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability\nenables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder\nto the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a\nlightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft\nslots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the\nsignal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%\npreference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged\nQ&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced\ntokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the\nmodel having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource\nlanguages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual\nalignment in lightweight LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that\nrequire long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in\nconversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often\nlack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple\nrecall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each\nmemory component.",

A key\naspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous\nelement of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of\nverbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception\ndetection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant\nchallenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,\nmakes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities\nin this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and\npresent a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game\nWerewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable\nground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:\neven powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood\nreliably.

The method freezes the\nbackbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to\nthe student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency\nand alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust\noptimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the\nmodel maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The\noverall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a\nregularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances\nalignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate\nits effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,\nincluding distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation\nbudgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and\ndistribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method\nsignificantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,\nand overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.\nThis work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more\ntrustworthy alignment mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by\ntheir sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

PETAR bridges\nglobal contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing\nclinically coherent and localized findings.

Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent\nsensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity.

However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task\nfor LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning\n(ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct\nanswers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However,\nchoosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model\nperformance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot\nexamples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first\ncriterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a\nsample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about\nits usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity\nof the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples\nbased on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations\nto determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under\nvarious combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nunderstanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global\ncross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store\ntheir outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass\n(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically\nimplausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.",

Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

    "abstract": "Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize\na fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging\nparadigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from\ndata so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream\ntasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call\npanprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction\ngeneralizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which\nrespectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or\nmany downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that\nlearn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with\n$\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^3)$ and $\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,\nsimultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can\nbe as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we\nimprove the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic\nomniprediction by a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample\ncomplexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key\ntechnical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a\nstatistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.",

    "abstract": "Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands\nsignificant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models\n(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance\nremains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based\napproaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high\ncomputational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents\noptimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph\nisomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging\nORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs\non optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization\nmodeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4\nachieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even\nleading reasoning models.",

Several techniques are known, with\ncompressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the\nvalue sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use\nmachine learning to capture correlations between keys and values.

The\nresulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure.

We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in\ngenerating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used\nsamplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its\nempirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its\nconvergence properties -- remains limited.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler\nand establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional\nassumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition\nparameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical\ndistributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler\nwith accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of\n$$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\min\\{d,L^2\\}}{T^2}\\right)~\\text{in\nKullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the\nnumber of iterations, and $\\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.\nThis result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <\n\\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence\nanalysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions.

    "abstract": "Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical\ncompositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational\nmusicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive\nmodels such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt\ntheory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical\nstructure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that\noperationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and\nannotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic\nTime Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and\ninter-segment relationships.\n  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further\nlabeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor\nI-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level.\nThis labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive\ninformation, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and\nresolution.\n  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within\ncompositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between\nintra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional\nscaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects\nperceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering\ndemonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural\nfeatures that extend beyond composer identity.\n  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a\nstructured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis,\nenabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through\nthe lens of listener perception.",

    "abstract": "Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often\nexpensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.\nPopulation-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data\nfrom multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow\ndistinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for\nmodels learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,\ntransfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to\nalign the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered\n\\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do\nnot consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --\nupdating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA\nmappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this\nmodel is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to\nselect the most informative observations to label -- leading to further\nreductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The\neffectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental\nbridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several\ndamage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It\nis found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data\nefficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This\nresult has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of\nstructures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime\nof a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be\nachieved.",

    "abstract": "The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving\nsymmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective\npreconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

    "abstract": "The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous\nnetwork environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and\nsignificant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing\nalgorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse\nand often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However,\nexisting methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on\nimpractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To\ntackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing\nframework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on\nits own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case\nperformance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved\nby enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS\nobjectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO\nconstellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively\noptimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious\nbaseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms\nend-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by\nresolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion\navoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust\nrouting.",

    "abstract": "To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the\nleakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated\nLearning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct\neffectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve\nsignificant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation\n(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose\nunderlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the\nsemi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised\nlearning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system\nas a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation\nperformance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic\nnonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is\nused; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and\nCartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The\nperformance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\\`a-vis particle\nfilters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.",

The gap stems from two fundamental\nchallenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens\nthat is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,\nand (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens\nthat couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical\ntokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms\nto ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the\nattention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional\nencoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive\nparadigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first\nand then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for\nunconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP.

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing\neffective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the\nextended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.\nRecent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,\ntheir modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research\nin this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,\nmaking it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel\nend-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\\textbf{M}ultimodal \\textbf{Ve}getation\n\\textbf{L}oss \\textbf{M}odeling \\textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise\nvegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration\npipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different\nmodalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through\nprobabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our\nmodel outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in\npredicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation\nloss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted\nrecovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future\ndisaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable\nlanguage models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and\ndifficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training\nof model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE\ncomponents, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a\nframework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning\nunknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable\nlatent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational\nalignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in\npreviously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)\nsteering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational\nalignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation\nwithout the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the\ncost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one\nhigh-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and\ncontrollable at minimal marginal cost.",

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,\nElev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are\nimportant for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,\ncanopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy\nemerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent\ntropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02\nMg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha .

    "abstract": "The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication\nrounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the\neffectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several\nbaselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test\naccuracy.",

This\nvisibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),\nbut only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).\nFully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on\nexamining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a\ncue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses\ninformation when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate\naspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more\nholistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT\nlists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and\nverbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves\nas the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes\nbased on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning\nmodels on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful\nyet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that\nmonitorability differs sharply across model families.

Given the real-world impracticalities of the market\nmaker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the\nhigh-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement\nlearning framework (Jain et al. 2025).

    "abstract": "The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical\ndata pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware\nmultimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:\n(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time\nseries, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and\nmacro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and\n(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be\nextended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between\nmodalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns\nresulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and\nMIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease\ndynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality\nprediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed\nstate-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series\nmodels, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;\nan AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the\nrobustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising\ntool in clinical prediction.

    "abstract": "Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is\ncentral to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability\nenables efficient analysis at pretraining scale.

Traditional\nbatch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor\nadaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,\nstreaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling\nseamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study\ninvestigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary\nclassification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while\nassessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated\nheterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and\nstreaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch\nmodels to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of\ncurrent datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.\nWe also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,\nwell-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,\nconfirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved\nF1-score of 0.990 $\\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch\ncounterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\\pm$ 0.007,\nreducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online\napplications despite a slight trade-off in stability.",

However, these\nkeyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to\nreduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.\n  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a\ntraining-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects\nquery-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe\nselection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed\nbandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and\nBernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving\nexploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage\nexploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with\ntheoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then\nselecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video\nquestion-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements\nwhile processing less than 2% of video frames.

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex\nreasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,\nperforming better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.",

Existing model-merging techniques,\ndesigned for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to\ndeliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static\ninterpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we\nintroduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free\nframework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the\nJensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3\ndynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to\ngeneralist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of\nsample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that\ncomputes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing\ncomputational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized\nmedical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol\nspanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.\nEmpirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error\nreduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving\nthe way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,\nuser requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast\nresponse, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on\nlarge models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency\nand energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of\nhandling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the\nstrengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first\nscenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new\nrouting strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate\nmodel for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We\nalso construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router\ntraining and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show\nthat our approach successfully routes over 80\\% of queries to the small model\nwhile incurring less than 10\\% drop in problem solving probability.",

Achieving a robust\nand highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,\nmainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately\nannotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare\nenvironments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from\ndifferences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical\npurposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past\ndata, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our\napproach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship\nbetween previously learned knowledge and new information across different\ntraining stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.\nSpecifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our\nmethod mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual\npretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature\ndistillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge\ndistillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of\nthe model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations.

To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis\n(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned\nfunction. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying\nits: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.\nCrucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which\ntracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This\ntemporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it\nlearns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical\nlearning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before\ncomplex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,\npractical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and\npredicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential\ngeometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification\nto a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.",

Existing defense strategies preemptively build\nrobustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)\nthe infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models\ndue to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)\nlimited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture\ntheir variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nBayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with\nno need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a\nBayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data\npoint's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment\ndatasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with\ntheir safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the\ninfluence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian\ninference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling\nBDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive\ndefense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized\nBayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.\nComprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

    "abstract": "Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.\nHowever, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they\nreach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss\nlandscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or\nprovides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor \"E\"\nfor gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue\nexploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)\nin order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a\nlocal minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and\nflatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We\nalso provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex\nand non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their\neffectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,\nlarge-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing\nresults show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy\n(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of\n2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially\nopens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.",

The system enhances quality control, predictive\nmaintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods:\nServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana,\nCassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It\nemploys machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect\nanomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write\nlatency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as\ntime-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected\nby the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time\nmonitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases\nsystem resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage,\nminimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally,\nServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with\nobservational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts\nalso improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management.\nConclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive\nmaintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures.

Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for\nadapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing\nlatency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization\nusing machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key\nlimitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among\nparameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification\nprevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,\nlimiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,\nto reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often\nselects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that\ncontribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most\ncommon method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on\nsurrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient\nexploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel\nframework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and\nlearns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.\nRelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),\nwhich combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity\nto previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple\nDBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and\nhigher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning\nmodels toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently\ndrawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of\nfairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set\nof nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each\nprotected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that\ngroup in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to\nincorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,\nparticularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a\ncomputationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a\nnew affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that\nfairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed\non this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$\nclusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the\nsolution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic\nblock model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair\nclustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair\ngraph clustering algorithms.",

Although AI survey chatbots\nimprove convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees\nor static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit\nindividual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.\nWe address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through\nReinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for\nAI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality\nusing a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and\nSpecificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy\nthat updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with\npriors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total\nchatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation\nacross 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual\nparticipants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12\nmean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over\nnon-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in\nspecification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior.

    "abstract": "Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since\nelectrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial\nnormalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,\nbut often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when\nlocalization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted\nbrain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between\nindividuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)\nlearns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from\nmulti-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive\nobjectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to\nregion-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a\ntransformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of\nchannels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal\nganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording\nsessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space\nsupports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,\nregion-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The\ntransformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or\nsupervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of\nmasked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.\nTogether, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject\naggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task\nstructure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes\nto a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better\nviewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.",

    "abstract": "Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both\ncompact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These\nresults highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow\nbenchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.\nTherefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a\ndiagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional\ngeneralization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed\nframework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance\ntoward truly universal video retrieval.",

Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on\nusers past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is\nnew to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical\ndata available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To\naddress this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial\nratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early\nunderstanding of the user's tastes.

Decision\ntree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about\ntheir preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is\ngathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach\nfor rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation.

This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM.

    "abstract": "Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and\ninefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none\nof the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key\ncapabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data\ncollection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that\nanswers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain\ndata. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single\npipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative\nof DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories\nof tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100\ninstances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have\ngained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of\nopen-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following\nDRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by\ncoordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs\nstructured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on\nDRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot\nachieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines\nwith up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost.

This survey investigates current\ndeep text hashing methods by categorizing them based on their core components:\nsemantic extraction, hash code quality preservation, and other key\ntechnologies. We then present a detailed evaluation schema with results on\nseveral popular datasets, followed by a discussion of practical applications\nand open-source tools for implementation. Finally, we conclude by discussing\nkey challenges and future research directions, including the integration of\ndeep text hashing with large language models to further advance the field.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern\ninformation ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover\nitems aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems\naddress a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past\ndecades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from\ncollaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to\nneural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of\ngenerative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion\nmodels, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which\nreconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative\nscoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified\ntripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than\nsimply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into\noperational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and\ntraining, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models\nenable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying\nheterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods,\nlarge recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their\nalignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new\ncapabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and\npersonalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world\nknowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities,\nscaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in\nbenchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a\nroadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape\nhuman-information interaction.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates\nefficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector\nsearch with complex relational filtering.

This\nwork introduces \\textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general\nfiltered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index\ndesigns. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF\nfor vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a\nprincipled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate\ngeneration and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass\nmaintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and\nrange predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or\nmulti-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nCompass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general\nframework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query\nthroughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings\nwith only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality\nand DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution\nfor achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.",

Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are\nmostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing\nefforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to\nreplicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we\nintroduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,\nrealized in a modular soft gripper architecture.

By integrating\nrich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly\ntransition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances\ngeneralization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and\nscales (up to 10$\\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities\nsuch as multi-object and internal hook grasping.

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training\non action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on\nRoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.",

    "abstract": "Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion\nPolicy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action\n(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high\ncomputational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead\nto divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address\nthese issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium\ndynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar\nenergy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,\nEBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior\nunder distribution shifts.",

Criticality metrics provide an\nobjective means of assessing safety.

This paper\nproposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify\nevasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index\n(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,\nenabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral\nconflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500\nhigh-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is\nthen compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.\nResults show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying\ncriticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI\nas a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety\nassessment framework for autonomous driving.

Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation\nflight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms\nto be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground\nstation control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.\nSwarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a\nGazebo simulation environment but also in real-world demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous\nrobots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies\nand synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental\nresults indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing\nnear-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online\nsolver.",

Conventional\ngrippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to\nobjects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that\ncombines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The\ngripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the\ninternal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.",

    "abstract": "Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a\nkey challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for\nlarge, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor\ncoverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich\nsurroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further\ndegrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily\ndeployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;\nhowever, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting\nunderwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic\nPositioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor\nfusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the \"mother-ship\" concept,\nthe surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a\nsubmerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly\nconstrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through\nrepeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time\ntrajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance\n(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed\ninfrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages\nadvances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step\nchange in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.",

While most\nrecent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing\n3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for\nmany real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and\nforest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of\nWildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals\nthe unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights\npotential improvements for future works.

    "abstract": "Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon\nmethods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret\ndiffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these\nmethods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high\nscanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the\noperating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the\nperformance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns\ncaptured at short exposure times (high scan speeds).

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

In practice, however,\nretrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations\nshaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such\nbiases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from\nprevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text\nretrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval.

    "abstract": "Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate\nword pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's\nhigh degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches\nhave significantly advanced performance on this task.\n  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization\nthat frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach\noperates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization\npattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,\nconditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is\nits use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text\nas an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the\ninput's vector representation.\n  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we\ndemonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying\non complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting\nwhere the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided\ncandidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic\narchitectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield\nsignificant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.\nThese findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for\naccurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.",

We present a practical\nimplementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a\nMAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically\naddresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and\nenables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we\nmonitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two\nmajor failure modes: routing errors (5.25\\%) and query rephrasal errors\n(3.2\\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements\nthrough fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a\nfine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,\nand 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\%\ngain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,\ntransforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings\ninclude approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,\nnavigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.\nThis work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive\nenterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve\naccuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training.",

Yet the question\nof whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal\nmasking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because\nfew domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same\ndataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which\nnaturally supports both representations. We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models\ntrained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} -\nconsistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on\nsequential data.

In this study, we address how\nperformance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and\nunder what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We\npresent a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight\nclassical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,\nimplemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined\nexperimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward\ndistribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive\nevaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show\nthat variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high\nuncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm\nrewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better\nin more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a\nfine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous\ndriving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a\ndual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric\ncomplexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused\nrepresentations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained\nVision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable\nconvolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion\nmodule aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The\ndecoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.\nTraining is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,\nLovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary\nprecision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and\nBerkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,\nGeneralized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in\nsegmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on\nCityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by\nmargins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,\nrespectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a\n0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning\ndynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of\nbenchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting\ndata efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm\nthat targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models\nenable reliable and scalable AD perception.",

    "abstract": "Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like\nTwitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,\nautomatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a\nchallenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data\nand extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important\naspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer\ninteractions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually\nappropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame\nAggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.\nThis method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to\ngenerate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their\nsemantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient\nweighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing\nless on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention\nmechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment\nreflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the\nlimitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language\ncontent with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,\ndiverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this\ndataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million\ncomments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to\nexisting methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue\ncontexts.",

As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate\nhow frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national\ndata protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites\nand identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the\nrelevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation\non 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic\nmanipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to\nmeasure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This\nenables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button\nplacement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common\nthan previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user\nand/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the\nEuropean Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,\nand websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU\nand from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU\nwebsites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU\nwebsites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than\nnon-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.",

The architecture is trained with a variance reduction\nstrategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and\ndifficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different\nchallenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022\nChallenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a\nstate-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH\ndataset.

These\nexperimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a\nrobust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases\nfor the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced\nindexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine\nlearning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi\npatterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high\nscan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of\ncrystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results.

    "abstract": "Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone\nstrength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density\ndistribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation\nmodels in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one\ndataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain\nshift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary\nacross institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable\nquantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center\nosteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite\nelement analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we\ndeveloped a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for\nmulti-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the\nlargest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT\nimages scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for\nproximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two\ncomplementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment\nvia Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding\nsite-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.\nThis dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling\nscanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.",

The\nmethod builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge\nrepresentations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing\nand retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing\ncloser semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an\nuncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and\nfilter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model\nto maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false\ncontent. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,\nentropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence\ncontrol framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and\ncomparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental\nconditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the\nproposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method\nachieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval\nrecall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.\nThis study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and\ncontrollability of large models in complex contexts.",

However,\nautomatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a\nchallenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data\nand extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important\naspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer\ninteractions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually\nappropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame\nAggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.\nThis method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to\ngenerate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their\nsemantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient\nweighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing\nless on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention\nmechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment\nreflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the\nlimitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language\ncontent with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,\ndiverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this\ndataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million\ncomments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to\nexisting methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue\ncontexts.",

The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define\nfine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text\nfields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of\nunderreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced\nduring patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are\ndefined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian\nPortuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by\nlinguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that\nthe methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of\n0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,\nlow-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted\nto other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,\nand explainable use of NLP in public health systems.",

    "abstract": "As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their\nactions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods\nprovide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic\nspecifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep\nlearning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language\nconstraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with\npotentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a\nscalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.\nCode and data are available at: https://repv-project.github.io/.",

Denario can perform many different tasks, such\nas generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,\nwriting and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a\nscientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle\nspecific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end\nscientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we\ndescribe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by\npresenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different\nscientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical\ninformatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,\nneuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from\ndifferent disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies\nmethods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We\nreport the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who\nprovided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the\nstrengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we\ndiscuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such\ntechnology relates to the philosophy of science.

First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from\nprevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text\nretrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval.

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their\nability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain\nfrom both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs\nreason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with\nnormative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a\ncommon formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a\nwide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic\ndomains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence\nhuman reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight\nchallenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and\nprovide insights for enhancing their reliability.

Our method is based on the principle that\ntokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,\nsuch as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our\ntechnique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the\naverage number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is\nmotivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules\nsuch as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a\nlarge dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with\nseveral popular tokenizers.

We present a practical\nimplementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a\nMAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically\naddresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and\nenables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we\nmonitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two\nmajor failure modes: routing errors (5.25\\%) and query rephrasal errors\n(3.2\\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements\nthrough fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a\nfine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,\nand 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\%\ngain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,\ntransforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings\ninclude approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,\nnavigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.\nThis work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive\nenterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve\naccuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training.",

In this work, we provide the first\nquantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization\nto occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG\nin several distinct problem settings: $\\ell_\\infty$ error control vs. average\nerror control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention\nvs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,\nand one- vs. two-layer transformers.

Our\nbounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for\na transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically.

    "abstract": "Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive\ntask that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions\nwithin complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing\nvision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with\nfine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven\nreasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic\nframework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,\ncombining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial\nand logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for\ndetecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that\nconstructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.\nEvaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior\nperformance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while\nmaintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI\napplications.",

Soft growing vine robot systems are\nparticularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,\nbut are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in\nreal-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and\nimplementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual\ncondition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design\nencloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,\nairtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference\nwhile enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed\nmechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a\npassively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and\ntransparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment\nand mapping task in a wastewater pipe.

To\ncircumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability,\nsensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information\nexchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology\nthrough a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true\nproportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go\nformulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions.\nFurthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve\nconvergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set\npredefined times, respectively.

    "abstract": "As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their\nactions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods\nprovide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic\nspecifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep\nlearning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language\nconstraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with\npotentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a\nscalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.\nCode and data are available at: https://repv-project.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must\naccomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to\ninformation acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in\nunstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps\n-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.\nWhile heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed\nspecifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can\naccomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,\ncurrent large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume\nwell-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured\nenvironments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations\nby grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous\nrobot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications\ndescribing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded\nsubtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to\nrobots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined\ngiven feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments\nwith closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice\nthe success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming\napproaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath\nHusky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an\n87\\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and\nrefining subtasks with online feedback.

This metric combines Dynamic Time\nWarping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties\nderived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our\nevaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial\ngrounding and goal localization.

To address these challenges, we propose a\ndistributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be\nrepresented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one\nagent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the\nother agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to\nneighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a\nsingle agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in\nsimulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple\nsingle-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\\\"ive,\nor assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The\nalgorithm outperforms the na\\\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and\nsum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of\nmakespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it\nis asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to\neither metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots\nconfirm the feasibility of the approach.",

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in\napplications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and\nrecommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

Specifically, our method\ncomputes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual\nadvantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off\nagents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where\nan arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,\nhomelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover\nfar-sighted, equitable policies.

To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors.",

    "abstract": "We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve\ncomplex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes\nbeyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce\nasynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large\nlanguage models, which organizes the internal thinking process into\nconcurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking\nprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges\nintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the\nthinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through\nreinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%\nlower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy\non mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned\nasynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without\nadditional training.",

Existing datasets in this domain are\ntypically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the\nspatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this\nlimitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with\nrich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million\nflights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along\nsequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and\n(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport\nresource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset\nis carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and\nstrict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine\nlearning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including\nregression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,\nserving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph\nmodalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to\nfacilitate adoption.

Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to\nvalid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific\ntypes of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those\nobserved in psychological studies of human reasoning.

    "abstract": "Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite\nbeing an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about\nfinding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph\nthat have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic\nframework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem\ndecomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,\nthereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}:\ninjecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the\nprobability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:\nemploying a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep\nexploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively\ncompresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration\ncost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing\nmulticlass calibration techniques.",

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

    "abstract": "Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI\ncapabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying\nquality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we\ncan leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an\nimportant safety problem that is already challenging for humans:\nfact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human\nratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.\nGiving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their\naccuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,\nconfidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results\nand evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications\nfor Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to\nsupervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.",

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

However, unauthorized commercial use of\nthese datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset\nowners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks.",

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating\nmore inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may\nalso strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same\nreasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought\nHijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful\nrequests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,\nCoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on\nGemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -\nfar exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness\nof our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers\nencode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the\nverification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting\nattention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads\nidentified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in\na safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of\nreasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined\nwith final-answer cues.

    "abstract": "Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing\nshort, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major\nchallenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks\nmostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking\nfine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative\ncoherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose\nLoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation\n(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,\nLoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating\nelements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics\nsuch as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content\nclarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on\nmore abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character\ndevelopment. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nnine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well\non basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event\nconsistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.\nOverall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for\nevaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical\ndirections for future method improvement.",

In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing\ndifficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining\nwith an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content\nand cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized\nMMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines\nstruggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target\ndomains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage\npoints. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also\nfacilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on\nnon-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,\nwhile maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks.

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate\ncontributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured\nrepresentations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)\npractices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software\nsystems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science\nresearch to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of\nthree cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,\nincluding collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering\n2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions\ninvolving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to\nsystematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and\nsoftware products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of\nGenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related\nresearch challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated\ninto a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a\nrigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author\nteams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation\nfor analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for\nframing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these\nfindings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.",

    "abstract": "Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on\ncomplex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train\nmulti-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural\nblindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the\nenvironment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,\nunguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking\npivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We\naddress these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which\ndynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and\nemploys graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning\nsignals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward\nhigh-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware\ncredit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's\nstrategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench\nbenchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success\nrate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These\nresults highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,\ngeneralizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is\nessential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic\nstudies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets\ncapture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot\nreasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire\ndata or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains\nunderexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,\nSPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such\ndata integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves\nscientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on\nhow to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a\nlightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further\nimprovements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and\nprompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile\nfoundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based\nquestionnaire analysis.",

In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction.

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

The\nrate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of\nhealthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine\nlearning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical\nfactors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the\nhealth claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component\nAnalysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building\nregression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area\nUnder Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance\nfollowed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models\ncan be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help\nidentify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately\nbringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the\npatients.",

Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy\nthat connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,\nSIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure\nmulti-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies\ntabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive\ninterface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and\nrefine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.\nThrough expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that\nSIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media\nwhile supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.",

Traditional approaches attempt to model\nthis through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges\nin specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that\nlearns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring\nexplicit utility specification.\n  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's\nportfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous\nweights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods\nbased on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified\nrewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns\ndirectly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.\n  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The\nlearned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as\n\"growth\" and \"value,\" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For\ninstance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of\nMarkowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for\nturnover, concentration, and latent factors.\n  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests\nthat explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are\ncontained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.\n  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment\nstrategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and\nregulatory oversight.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function\nlevel, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in\nauthentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a\nnovel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world\nclasses divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization\nunder practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied\ninput specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation\ncompleteness levels.\n  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%\ncorrectness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on\nreal-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel\ncodebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in\nfunctional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.\nRetrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial\ndocumentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete\nimplementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies\nAttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of\ncases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world\nscenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation\nreduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.\n  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM\ncapabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for\nenhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval\nintegration in production code assistance tools.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in\nthe research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

To study this, we introduce\nEgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized\negocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural\nlanguage. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal\nVerification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but\nconsistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of\nexisting Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with\nresults far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively\nfinetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved\nconsistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For\nimprovements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework\nthat effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging\nconsistent comprehension across viewpoints.

To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted\nMulti-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the\ninput image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the\nprompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by\nsolely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods\nthat primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.\nConsequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal\ndiffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with\nfixed prompts.

    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance\nbased on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to\naveraging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate\nsettings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human\ndevelopment and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE\npackage is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe",

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and\nhigher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the\npotential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and\ncongestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard\nbenchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their\ngeneralization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

However, existing vision-language models\n(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract\nfine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also\nhinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting\ntabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various\nattributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON\ntemplate to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically\ntailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing\nmotion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,\noffering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation\nthrough advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control\nsystems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object\ndetection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in\nComputer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable\nprogress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains\nfragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative\nintelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking\nanalysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI\nrather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically\nreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,\nand Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their\ncapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their\npotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception\nframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that\nmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,\nand cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a\ncross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze\ncutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to\nhybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven\napproaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language\nModels (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey\ndelivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future\nopportunities.",

It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.",

The UAV dataset, acquired over\nVicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks.

    "abstract": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),\nplays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical\napplications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,\nthe adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as\na promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal\nimage analysis.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

    "abstract": "Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few\nknown normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose\nthe Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and\nfine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with\nautomatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

    "abstract": "Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for\nadapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on\nlabeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to\nachieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM\ncalibration during test-time adaptation.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel\ntwo-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation\naccuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to\nexisting segmentation methods.

Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints\nrecovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven\nmap lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds\nmemory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth\nconsistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten\ngeometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple\nand pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a\nstandardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and\nnovel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons\nand sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and\nsteadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while\nmaintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard\nmonitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring\nrobust multimodal perception.",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged\nand elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental\nhealth. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making.",

Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their\nreal-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our\nbenchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and\n$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to\n$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity\nsimulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital\ndynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are\nprovided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.\nBuilding upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based\nscheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A\ndedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and\noperational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative\nlearning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution\nfor AEOS constellation scheduling.

To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a\nnovel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,\nCATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates\nmode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning\nsignals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit\nconstraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the\ngenerated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,\nCATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during\ngeneration, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style.

    "abstract": "Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of\nbalancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for\nsustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4\nproduct relation classification, respectively.

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer\nanimation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and\nsubjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses\nprevious ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are\noften of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we\npropose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework\nusing Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion\nrepresentations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality\nfrom a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale\nfeature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new\ntraining method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained\nmotion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a\nmotion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods\nin both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people\ninteract with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding\nentities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)\nplays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no\ncomprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables\nscenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG\nbenchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse\nset of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn\nconversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to\nmimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to\nreflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of\nimage-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing\ninformation dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:\nsingle-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn\nconversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for\nboth image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that\nstraightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM\nsingle- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry\nsolutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for\nimprovement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K\nparticipants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline\nperformance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.",

    "abstract": "Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical\nlocation and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The\nresults show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw\ndetection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values\nabove 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse\ntraffic scenarios.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are\npre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing\nrobustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces\na novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer\nclassification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram\nimages and synthetic radiology reports.

In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR\nfor AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency\npriors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation\nunit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a\nsecond-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of\nadjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and\ncontent-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios.

Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

    "abstract": "Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in\nthe research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.",

To address these challenges, we propose a\nunified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses\nwithout requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D\nGaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization\nstrategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity\nand pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization\ninto two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via\ndifferentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses\nusing a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and\nphotometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection\nerrors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations\nand sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive\nevaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also\nsurpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.",

However,\ncurrent OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS\ninvolves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,\nand (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a\ncritical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,\ncompiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we\npresent OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured\nmanagement and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly\nintegrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models\n(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,\nwhich is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,\ncleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M\nsingle-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent\nleverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in\nretrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior\nperformance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,\nsurpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,\nGPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can\neffectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS\nresearch.

Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps.

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

In practice, they depend on a\nnon-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of\nhyperparameters like temperature and top-p.

We augment the standard transformer with\nlightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific\ntemperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach\ntransforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model\nto self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\n  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that\nAutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but\nalso achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from\n\"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method.\nCrucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding\ncontrol: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,\n\"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p\non a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive\nLLM decoding.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for\nthe first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across\nvarious scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an\nexpressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited\nfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain\nwisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and\nensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as\nimplicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel\nframework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to\nsystematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,\nwithout requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts\ndomain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core\nontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both\nunmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%\nimprovement in accuracy.

To fill\nthis gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent\nrecipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison\nbetween RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,\npretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\\sim$150M\nto $\\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for\ninstruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling\nscaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall\nmore compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling\nand context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM\nachieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while\nenjoying substantially better inference efficiency.

We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

    "abstract": "Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.\nLegal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,\nlexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose\nsignificant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While\nrecent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate\nnoisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided\nextraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework\naddresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and\ndomain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and\nlegal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to\nquantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results\nshow that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node\nduplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured\nprompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in\nnoisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust\nLLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex\nlegal texts.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of\nmultiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable\nassessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.\n  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were\nprocessed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.\nRadiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models\nand a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot\nprompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually\nreviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and\nconsensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were\ntested for rating the performance of the triage tool.\n  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The\nhighest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).\nThe average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).\nLlama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater\nprecision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the\nideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3\nEnsemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522\n(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between\nTop-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\n  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a\nmore consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective\nevaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive\nscenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple\nturns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users\niteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate\nresults. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a\nbenchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike\nprevious manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated\ntwo-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree\nrepresentations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task\ngeneration, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.\nHuman evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further\npropose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions\namong an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.\nThe model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.\nDySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling\n1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the\nPass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty.

    "abstract": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian\nnetwork LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three\nLLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic\nmechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the\nsentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a\nBayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with\ndistinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates\nconsistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,\nunderscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of\nprobabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.",

    "abstract": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models\nexplore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,\nthis imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew\neffect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to\nperformance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four\nefficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and\ntrajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the\nexploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on\nQwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning\ncapabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables\ndevelopers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.\nTo streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review\napproaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly\nadvanced the capabilities of automated review generation.

To mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG\ntechnique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security\nissues.

    "abstract": "Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge\nin software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can\naccurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended\nfor a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle\naccuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The\nimproved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug\ndetection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases\nfrom 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of\nautomated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained\ncategories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and\n20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of\nquestion formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid\nfoundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.\nExtensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs\nreveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro\nsurpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the\nbest-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.\nThese results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the\nchallenges of applying LLMs in education.",

In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for\nautomatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including\ntheir internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method\nconstructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from\nthe semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community\ndetection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse\nLLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent\ngroups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with\nspecific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines\non downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of\nmanually-curated teams based on known model specializations.

We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By\npruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with\nminimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide\nreliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.",

However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances.

Current RAG evaluation\nbenchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant\nchunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only\nlocalized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable\nways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data\nencodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method\nfor practitioners to better understand and use preference data.",

    "abstract": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their\npractical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and\ntransferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",

Their prevalence, features, and\nclinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and\ndeploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in\nradiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior\nthyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from\nJuly 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer\noverdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective\nfollow-up.",

    "abstract": "Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale\nremains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

    "abstract": "We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by\nPermuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random\nnumber generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "abstract": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been\npredominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between\nentities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how\nmemory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in\nturn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition\ninto an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding\ngeometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,\ndespite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly\nattributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.\nCounterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more\nsuccinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry\nstems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed\narises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also\npoints to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more\nstrongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages\nrevisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like\nknowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

    "abstract": "The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a\ntreatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally\nefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step\ntypically required in EWM.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.",

Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the\nalignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which\nmodels learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at\nwhich stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's\npost-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values.",

This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary\nexpert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral\nframework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing\nexpert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both\ntwo-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively\nquery only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active\nlearning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and\nthe core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost\nand predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our\nalgorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.\nEmpirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially\nreduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating\nthe practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.",

Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM\nimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.",

In many\nreal-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM\ncustomization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range\nof tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate\ncost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a\nmixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.\nSpecifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific\nrows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components\nto higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B\nmodels on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks.

This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse\nensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of\nsimulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz\ndesign for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image\nclassification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing.

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level\nobservations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is\nbecoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.",

    "abstract": "Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted\nprobabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class\nfrequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong\ncalibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities\nto be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing\napproaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,\nwhich makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of\nthe feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant\nin high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are\nexactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this\nmain shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.\nFirst, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its\nrelationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the\npitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local\ncalibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local\ncalibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted\nprobabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon\ndistance.

We\nalso analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of\nvariation.

To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose.

    "abstract": "The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of\napplications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.",

OOD inputs, such as unseen\npathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence\npredictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD\ndetection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and\nunseen classes separately.

This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models\nvia latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world\nmodels. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent\naction model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant\ntraining and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple\nand appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with\na powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and\nprone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which\nfor the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving\nthe core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that\neffectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the\npre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model\nacts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,\nwhile the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the\nworld model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage\nmethods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,\nestablishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.",

Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems\nthat simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student\nthinking or learning needs.\n  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process\nto a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:\nautomated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and\nvisualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The\nmodel is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure\npedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.\n  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,\nthe system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor\ncomments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on\n1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters\nbased on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,\nallowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.\n  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive\nvisualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting\ntargeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.",

Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the\ncontext length, we present an efficient input representation for the central\nagent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a\nFourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal\ntrends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient\nrepresentation of the MARL environment.

    "abstract": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking.",

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.",

Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity.

    "abstract": "Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining\ncausal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed\ninterventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional\ndata. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating\ninterventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures\nconsistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also\nfacilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be\ncostly to identify.",

    "abstract": "Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation\nwireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision\nlocalization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution\ntechniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,\nwhile generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models\nthat lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSymbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based\nAngle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained\nsymbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam\npattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER\nachieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and\ninterpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower\nBounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and\naccurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA\nestimation.",

However, storing and replaying\ndata is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical\nfor arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without\naccess to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to\nsynthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing\nsamples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)\ngenerating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between\nsynthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)\ninversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through\nthe full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as\nCLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),\ninspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides\nstrong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing\niterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via\nGaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between\nsynthetic and real features.

Graph-based approaches have become increasingly\nimportant for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and\nstatic structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and\ntemporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by\nincorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,\nenabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current\nresearch on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse\nmodeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of\nstandardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey\nof HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a\ntaxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze\nrepresentative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also\nreview commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges\nrelated to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for\nfuture research.

To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose\nOff-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on\noffline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that\nexplicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the\nsecond challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting\nwith active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited\nnumber of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster\nstructure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,\nA$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative\ndimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively\ncollected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones.

However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the\nmulti-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood\ninterpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective\nmolecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single\ngeneration pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline\noptimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.\nNotably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can\nbe integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)\npractices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software\nsystems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science\nresearch to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of\nthree cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,\nincluding collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering\n2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions\ninvolving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to\nsystematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and\nsoftware products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of\nGenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related\nresearch challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated\ninto a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a\nrigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author\nteams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation\nfor analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for\nframing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these\nfindings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to\nidentify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats\nemerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly\nresolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself\nfaithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the\nsecret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or\nthe adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be\nprivate, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the\ndilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),\nenabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third\nparties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of\n`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints\nare built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and\nsummation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,\ncovering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and\nfour ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of\ncircumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public\nverifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without\ncompromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving\ntheir general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable\nartificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This\nenables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing\nclassification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple\nexperiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using\nCNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).\nExperiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model\nwith a high computational cost reduction.

The proposed\nsystem integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a\nhigh-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,\ndelivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels\nenable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,\ntermed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the\nedge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt\nto environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated\nhardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%\nto 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored\nthe accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for\ndynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT\nenvironments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term\nautonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.",

Despite\nthe progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or\nitems to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in\nreal-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and\nmodel-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying\nmulti-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows\nthat naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several\ndomain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained\nsolely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first\nexperimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based\ncross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and\ntarget domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.\nWeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not\nintroduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the\nupper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments\non single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation\nscenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation\nand consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation\ntasks.",

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence.

Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference.

This paper introduces the Open Recommendation\nBenchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified\nbenchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.\nORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with\nreproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.\nAdditionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,\nfeaturing web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.\nClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and\nprivacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation\nscenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to\nchallenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12\nrepresentative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a\nprompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results\nreflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,\nwith variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal\nthe limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation\nand highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations.

    "abstract": "In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become\nwidely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.",

    "abstract": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection.

To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and\nembodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,\nscalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

The\neffectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and\nreal-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first\nhardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a\nthree-dimensional task.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic\nmanipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with\nRL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at\nintermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue\napplications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while\nperforming intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight\nThor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans\nperceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with\nchildren, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and\ndistress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises\ncomplex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds\nare broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative\nsurvey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is\nviewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and\ngovernment. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and\nparental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of\nwhether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters\npropose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while\nopponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.\nUltimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared\nresponsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by\ndetailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete\ndesign and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot\ndiscontinuation.",

By\nrepresenting the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based\npolicy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable\nlearning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is\nvalidated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion\nprimitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It\nshows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,\nand improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer\ndirectly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable\nreal-world locomotion.

The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against\nopponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world.

Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

    "abstract": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

    "abstract": "We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with\nOlympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.\nExisting benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for\nevaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for\nassessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results\nhighlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in\ncurrent LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into\nadvancing the reasoning abilities of language models.\nhttps://amo-bench.github.io/",

    "abstract": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

However,\ntraditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are\ninefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant\nvector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to\nsignificant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage\narchitecture. While a decoupled architecture reduces query performance. To\novercome this limitation, we design two tailored strategies: (i) a three-stage\nquery mechanism that leverages multiple PQ compressed vectors to filter invalid\nI/O and computations, and (ii) an incremental page-level topological reordering\nstrategy that incrementally inserts new nodes into pages containing their most\nsimilar neighbors to mitigate read amplification. Together, these techniques\nsubstantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search.\nExperimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed\nby 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query\nand incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the\ntraditional coupled architecture.",

However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the\naccuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling\ndependable performance across real-world applications.",

While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable\nfor microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures\nfor trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics\nand magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.\nIn the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the\nnotion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization\nusing a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and\ncycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and\n2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings\nprovides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress\nenabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the\nactual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve\nresults comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

    "abstract": "Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due\nto their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video\ngeneration.

In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to\nunseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning\nstrategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context\nattention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential\neffect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect\nimitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient\none-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on\ntough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories\nof effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain\neffects.

    "abstract": "Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,\nand animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.",

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

    "abstract": "Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed\ntomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and\ntreatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this\nstudy, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver\ntumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+\nwith various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and\nState-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.\nSurprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models\nconsistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across\nmultiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we\nintroduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating\nthe Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.\nResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a\nDice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise\nboundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The\nmodel's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of\n0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately\nidentifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance\ninterpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the\nregion's most influential predictions, providing insights into its\ndecision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet\narchitecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly\ncompetitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising\ndirection for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.",

To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs.

Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,\nglobal prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,\nwhile personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We\npropose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt\nTuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and\npersonalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs.

For each\ninput, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived\nfrom global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables\nper-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable\nparameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated\naveraging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,\nTinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT\nconsistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data\nheterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and\ngeneralizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.",

To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space.

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly\nreduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various\nsystem and data dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,\nenabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,\ntool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,\nthese models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,\nthereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited\nperformance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we\npropose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a\ntool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.\nSpecifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given\nquery, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a\ntree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability\nto produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step\nacross different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps\nunder the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards\nare used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with\ntrajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments\nutilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and\ntime-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify\nthe necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we\ncompare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.",

For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely\nsampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to\noverfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address\nthis gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that\nreformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL\ntrains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing\nto each action.

This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all\nrollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert\ndemonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging\nproblems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training\nwith SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.\nBeyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software\nengineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework\nfor reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of\n1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x\nattention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.",

In this work, we investigate\nthese assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse\nmultilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a\nsignificant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages\nincreases in models at this scale.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation\ntasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when\nhuman judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking\ntraces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging\nto collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer\nthinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a\nsimple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at\nscale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:\n(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation\nguidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods\nlead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined\nannotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These\nresults suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise\nunrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended\ninto thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM\nraters.",

Although diagrams\nare presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce\nclear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction\nis to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which\ncan leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs).

In this paper, we propose\nDiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration\ndiagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams\nas graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed\nedges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node\nalignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate\ndiagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,\nquantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show\nhow the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable\ninsights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

    "abstract": "Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and\ngeneration within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous\ndata and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data\ninto understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.\nWe first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for\nunderstanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,\nforming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation\nsample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a\nretrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired\nstructures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent\npolicy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware\nvariant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity\nscore to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from\nwell-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality\ndataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on\nthe powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on\nvarious UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a\ngateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates\nwith differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization\nwithout weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are\npart of each public statement.

Despite\nrecent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their\nability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of\nEHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference.

FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech.

The hidden\nstate is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially\nlarge Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state\nvia unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it\nunifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial\nobservation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control\nfor input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with\nup to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,\nand language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to\nobtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum\nmemory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit\nreadouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine\ntranslation.

To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse\nreal-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona\n(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and\nNarrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation\nof LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion\nconsistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,\nand syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models\nachieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of\ncapabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the\naverage performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human\nbaseline.",

Current paradigms either myopically\noptimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,\ncreating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs\ninto a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,\nour model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,\nproving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,\nreal-world impact.

To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD\nsequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches\nthat rely on independent generations.",

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases.

This study examines\nLLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and\nwhether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show\nthat larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while\nsmaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,\nimplicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and\nquality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.\nOverall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded\nprompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually\nnuanced communication.

    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).\nHowever, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,\ndynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers\ndemonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing\nit as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.",

    "abstract": "In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in\nmodeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

    "abstract": "AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external\nknowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time.",

    "abstract": "Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications\nsuch as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive\ndevices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that\nthe curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all\nsurfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature\nincreases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the\naccuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling\ndependable performance across real-world applications.",

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --\nspecifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To\nthis end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the\nenvironment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance\nfields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to\ngenerate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.\nWe then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to\nsynthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of\ncaution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The\nsafety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety\nconstraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a\nsemantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

    "abstract": "Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a\nlong-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling\nbetween body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design.",

State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods\nfocused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a\ntask to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these\nmethods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with\nthe correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,\ngrasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,\nespecially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\n30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation\ntool-usage tasks.",

Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates\nsocial awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve\nprescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is\nassigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or\nself-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system.\nBuilding on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT\nframework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its\nsocial interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law\nis derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby\navoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a\nsocially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The\nproposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is\ncomputationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances.\nThe effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through\nsimulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional",

    "abstract": "In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an\nabstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics\nproblems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the\ndownward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain.",

Previous\nstudies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying\nprinciples with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether\nwhip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features\nobserved in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.\nPlatform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while\nsystematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of\npropagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding\nmedium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new\nperspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential\nplatform for future hydrodynamic research.",

    "abstract": "Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by\nencoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp\napplication that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning\nusing the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets\nwill be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),\nhave been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent\nchallenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full\nocclusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%\nocclusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the\nrobustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot\nvision applications.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for\ncomplex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.",

Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization.

However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care\nrobots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on\nhandcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse\nscenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the\nhuman brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which\nunderlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory\nsignals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "The development of synthesis procedures remains a fundamental challenge in\nmaterials discovery, with procedural knowledge scattered across decades of\nscientific literature in unstructured formats that are challenging for\nsystematic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal toolbox that\nemploys large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to\nautomatically extract and organize synthesis procedures and performance data\nfrom materials science publications, covering text and figures. We curated 81k\nopen-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing\nsynthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes,\nstructured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The\nextraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis\nprocedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable\nLLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source\nsoftware library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora\nand synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible\ninfrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable\ninformation. This lays the groundwork for predictive modeling of synthesis\nprocedures as well as modeling synthesis--structure--property relationships.",

However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness.

We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG\nthrough trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,\nR3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within\nthe RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the\nenvironment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the\nretriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original\nretriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving\ncomparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on\npost-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,\nrequiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

We present PerFine, a\nunified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization\nthrough iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM\ngenerator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic\nLLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on\ntone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then\nrevises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across\niterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,\nGoodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization\nover PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5\nrefinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These\nresults highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful\nparadigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and\nmodel-agnostic.",

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow.

Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards.

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,\nDUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the\nmain traffic for hundreds of millions of users.",

The robot arm end effector was modified to mount an E3D hotend\nthermally regulated by an IoT microcontroller, enabling precise temperature\ncontrol through real-time feedback. Filament extrusion system was synchronized\nwith robotic motion, coordinated via ROS2, ensuring consistent deposition along\ncomplex trajectories. A vision system based on OpenCV detects layer-wise\ndefects position, commanding autonomous re-extrusion at identified sites.\nExperimental validation demonstrated successful defect mitigation in printing\noperations. The integrated system effectively addresses challenges real-time\nquality assurance. Inverse kinematics were used for motion planning, while\nhomography transformations corrected camera perspectives for accurate defect\nlocalization. The intelligent system successfully mitigated surface anomalies\nwithout interrupting the print process. By combining real-time thermal\nregulation, motion control, and intelligent defect detection & correction, this\narchitecture establishes a scalable and adaptive robotic additive manufacturing\nframework suitable for aerospace, biomedical, and industrial applications.",

Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical\ncomputing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's\nconstituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output\nevolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework\nfor embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique\nstrategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,\nand physical algorithmic computing.

    "abstract": "The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot\nscheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial\nlogistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist\nfor planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate\ntoward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the\nrobots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic\nPrize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the\npresence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy\nconstraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and\nstar graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs\nthat coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a\nrank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal\nRank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in\ntemporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious\nOrdinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's\nsenior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and\nsynthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show\nthat 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies\nthat scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the\nglobal index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced\nprize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.\nFinally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%\noptimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer\nlinear programming.",

In practice, these\ncovariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,\nfront-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating\nnoise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian\nperspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and\nsupervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with\ncomputational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian\ndependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at\nthe lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation\nestimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients\nin parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the\ncovariance to guide the lower-level estimation.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained\nrobotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling\nnative temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical\nunderstanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training\nmethodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic\nsystems.",

CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data\nfrom the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the\nquadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning\nsequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained\nprominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where\nachieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of\ntasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates\na (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the\ntask's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is\ncompelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that\ncloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its\nfully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg\ninsertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from\nthe Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical\nanalysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with\n$\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to\nthe demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and\npractice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with\nfewer demonstrated tasks.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language\nreasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital\nand physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four\nmodel families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving\n$\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a\nsignificant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era\nof Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human\nwelfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of\nrobots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex\ntask planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up\nnew pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents\noften lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control\ntasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic\nmanipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical\nworld. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises\na human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an\naction execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a\nvision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task\nperformance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent\nachieves a 28\\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real\nenvironments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly\nimproving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction\ntasks.",

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation\nLearning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and\ncovariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is\ntypically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and\nmaps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We\nintroduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory\nScoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs\nwithout losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of\nour knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only\nlearning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.\nZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable\nactions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three\nbenchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop\nplanning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM\n(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on\nHUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.",

Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Financial documents are essential sources of information for regulators,\nauditors, and financial institutions, particularly for assessing the wealth and\ncompliance of Small and Medium-sized Businesses. However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question\nanswering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the\nlargest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to\nmitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval\nstrategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,\nknowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose\nTagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy\nthat boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and\naltering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our\nhypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant\nquestion-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging\nthe context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to\nconsistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token\ncontexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop\nqueries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

Existing POI\nrecommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and\nsequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a\nfundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent\nhierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts\nof user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nGTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.\nGTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces\nfor different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in\nhyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel\nMamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent\nspace. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.",

This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents\nand hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between\nuser implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys\nIntent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework\nREVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online\ndecision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit\nuser demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine\ndiscrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we\nanalyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly\nreasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as\nactionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage,\nREVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis\nover query images and associated historical products to generate optimization\nplans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our\nframework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with\ntraditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across\ninformation aggregation and user interaction.

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval\nstrategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of\nretrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when\nto retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved\ninformation effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a\nquery-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality\nselection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response\nquality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction\nTuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize\nretrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we\nadopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert\nquestion-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation\nquality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.",

An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods. VRisker reduces worst-case intent failures by up to 33% with a minimal\n2% drop in average performance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities\nin tool use, yet progress in tool retrieval remains hindered by incomplete and\nheterogeneous tool documentation. To address this challenge, we introduce\nTool-DE, a new benchmark and framework that systematically enriches tool\ndocumentation with structured fields to enable more effective tool retrieval,\ntogether with two dedicated models, Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank. We design a\nscalable document expansion pipeline that leverages both open- and\nclosed-source LLMs to generate, validate, and refine enriched tool profiles at\nlow cost, producing large-scale corpora with 50k instances for embedding-based\nretrievers and 200k for rerankers. On top of this data, we develop two models\nspecifically tailored for tool retrieval: Tool-Embed, a dense retriever, and\nTool-Rank, an LLM-based reranker. Extensive experiments on ToolRet and Tool-DE\ndemonstrate that document expansion substantially improves retrieval\nperformance, with Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank achieving new state-of-the-art\nresults on both benchmarks. We further analyze the contribution of individual\nfields to retrieval effectiveness, as well as the broader impact of document\nexpansion on both training and evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight both\nthe promise and limitations of LLM-driven document expansion, positioning\nTool-DE, along with the proposed Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank, as a foundation for\nfuture research in tool retrieval.",

    "abstract": "In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from\nunstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and\ndynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)\nconstruction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of\nreal-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent\nzero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance\non prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as\nwell as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that\nbuilds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from\nunstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained\n\"atomic\" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it\nconstructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling\nthat distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The\nresulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%\nbetter stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,\ndemonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Recommendation (NLRec) generates item suggestions based on\nthe relevance between user-issued NL requests and NL item description passages.\nExisting NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item\nrelevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request\nembeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as\nthe sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered\non the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To\nbetter capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring\nfunction that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses\nGaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of\ncandidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones\ndemonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal\nrelevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels\n(dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR,\ncross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall,\nGPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal\nLLM labeling budget.",

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including\n2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across\nfour complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language\ndescriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables\nresearch on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,\nand automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports\nbroader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software\nmining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for\nscalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM\narchitectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level\nhuman semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent\nsystems that reason about code.
